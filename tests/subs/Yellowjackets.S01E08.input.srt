00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:31,832
<i>Simone doesn't make you</i>
<i>feel "it" anymore?</i>

678
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:34,210
<i>No.</i>

679
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,588
<i>But you know what?</i>
<i>It's okay.</i>

680
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:42,468
<i>What we have is different.</i>
<i>It's stable. It's safe.</i>

681
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,595
<i>And-and... and I like that.</i>

682
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,597
<i>It just, um...</i>

683
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,725
<i>you know, "it"--</i>
<i>whatever that really means--</i>

684
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,019
<i>it-it wasn't any good for me.</i>

685
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:55,022
<i>It's like if</i>
<i>someone made me feel "it"...</i>

686
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:59,610
<i>[chuckles] ...it wasn't gonna</i>
<i>be good for anybody, you know?</i>

687
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:05,700
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-[exhales]</i>

688
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:09,078
<i>[sighs]</i>
<i>I think I do.</i>

689
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,681
<i>My turn.</i>

690
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,850
<i>Ah. Okay.</i>

691
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:33,060
<i>-Hi.</i>
<i>-Hi.</i>

692
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:36,147
<i>[door rumbles]</i>

693
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,607
<i>Oh. These...</i>

694
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:43,571
<i>[sighs] So, uh,</i>
<i>I was just thinking, and, um,</i>

695
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:46,657
<i>our interactions have been</i>
<i>so kind of, uh...</i>

696
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,201
<i>-how should I put it...</i>
<i>-Hot.</i>

697
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:51,704
<i>...singularly focused,</i>

698
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:56,500
<i>that, uh, I realized I don't</i>
<i>know anything about you.</i>

699
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,421
<i>I seem to recall you mocked</i>
<i>all my efforts on that front,</i>

700
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,257
<i>but yeah, sure.</i>
<i>What do you want to know?</i>

701
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:08,304
<i>How about you tell me</i>
<i>more about...</i>

702
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,474
<i>your art school days?</i>

703
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,893
<i>You went to Pratt, right?</i>

704
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,227
<i>What was that like?</i>

705
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:17,104
<i>Oh...</i>

706
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:20,274
<i>I mean, pretentious, mostly.</i>
<i>[chuckles softly]</i>

707
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,656
<i>What classes did you take?</i>

708
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:32,036
<i>Who was your favorite professor?</i>

709
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,164
<i>[Adam]</i>
<i>Um...</i>

710
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,166
<i>Okay.</i>

711
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,918
<i>I take it you did some digging,</i>

712
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,711
<i>and you caught me.</i>

713
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,547
<i>Yeah, I didn't go to Pratt,</i>

714
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,758
<i>but I had a girlfriend</i>
<i>who went there, Lauren,</i>

715
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,844
<i>and I spent so much time</i>
<i>with her and her friends,</i>

716
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,055
<i>that it kind of felt</i>
<i>like I went there.</i>

717
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,932
<i>Um...</i>

718
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:55,393
<i>Uh, look, I-I just told you</i>
<i>'cause I wanted to impress you.</i>

719
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,604
<i>Did it?</i>

720
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,190
<i>[inhales]</i>

721
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,150
<i>Where did you grow up?</i>

722
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,860
<i>Suburbs of Houston.</i>

723
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:05,986
<i>High school?</i>

724
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,072
<i>Milby High, class of '04.</i>
<i>Go, Buffs.</i>

725
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:10,074
<i>-Do you have any siblings?</i>
<i>-An older brother.</i>

726
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,576
<i>-Where is he now?</i>
<i>-Ann Arbor, Michigan.</i>

727
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:15,037
<i>He's a colorectal surgeon.</i>

728
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,332
<i>[chuckles] And he has</i>
<i>this book in his house</i>

729
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:21,001
<i>that's just called</i> <i>Anus.</i>

730
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,754
<i>I'm a ten-year-old,</i>

731
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,756
<i>but it still makes me laugh.</i>

732
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,092
<i>Okay, um, as much</i>
<i>as I would love...</i>

733
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,760
<i>[sighs]</i>

734
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,220
<i>...to believe you finally</i>
<i>want to get to know me...</i>

735
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,931
<i>Why don't you tell me</i>
<i>what this is really about?</i>

736
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:37,101
<i>Are you trying to catch me</i>
<i>lying about things?</i>

737
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:39,937
<i>'Cause I swear it was just</i>
<i>the stupid Pratt thing.</i>

738
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,564
<i>It's a crazy thing to lie about.</i>

739
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,442
<i>Well... [chuckles]</i>
<i>I know. I'm sorry.</i>

740
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:48,070
<i>But the rest of it, Shauna, us,</i>

741
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,281
<i>that's real.</i>

742
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:52,450
<i>Look, I've got this friend</i>

743
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,743
<i>with a cabin in the woods</i>
<i>in the Poconos.</i>

744
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:57,288
<i>Let's go away for the weekend.</i>

745
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:59,331
<i>Okay? I'll be an open book.</i>

746
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,125
<i>You can ask me anything.</i>

747
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,543
<i>My first kiss,</i>

748
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,462
<i>my favorite color, my shoe size.</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

749
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,755
<i>Whatever you want.</i>
<i>Ask me anything.</i>

750
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,757
<i>[stammers]</i>

751
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,801
<i>How do you propose</i>
<i>I explain that?</i>

752
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,097
<i>I don't give a shit.</i>

753
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,141
<i>[both chuckle]</i>

754
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,602
<i>Just go pack a bag,</i>

755
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,687
<i>and get back here.</i>

756
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,575
<i>[birds singing softly]</i>

757
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,962
<i>I have an announcement.</i>

758
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,468
<i>-Hello!</i>
<i>-[groans]</i>

759
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,721
<i>-Hi! Excuse me!</i>
<i>-[all groaning]</i>

760
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,016
<i>Thank you.</i>

761
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:02,520
<i>In light of the expedition</i>
<i>ending as it did,</i>

762
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,563
<i>I have decided</i>
<i>that I'm going to take</i>

763
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,315
<i>the dead guy's plane</i>
<i>and fly south.</i>

764
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,983
<i>I'm going to find us help,</i>

765
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,152
<i>and I'm going to get us</i>
<i>out of here.</i>

766
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,071
<i>You're gonna fly?</i>

767
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:15,115
<i>But y-you don't know how.</i>

768
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:17,493
<i>I've been studying</i>
<i>the flight manual for weeks,</i>

769
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,620
<i>and I checked the gas tank,</i>
<i>it's full.</i>

770
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:20,871
<i>I used to watch my grandpa fly.</i>

771
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,540
<i>He even let me steer</i>
<i>a few times.</i>

772
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:25,125
<i>I know that I can do this.</i>

773
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:28,087
<i>You can't deny that Van needs</i>
<i>serious medical attention.</i>

774
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,592
<i>She's not the only one.</i>

775
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:39,306
<i>Shauna, tell them.</i>

776
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,891
<i>I-I really don't...</i>

777
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,017
<i>Tell them.</i>

778
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,061
<i>-What is it?</i>
<i>-Yeah, tell us what?</i>

779
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,067
<i>I'm-I'm pregnant.</i>

780
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,278
<i>You were having sex?</i>

00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,029
<i>-How far along are you?</i>
<i>-[Mari] Wait,</i>

782
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,864
<i>did you get knocked up here?</i>

783
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:56,907
<i>No, I...</i>

784
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,409
<i>It doesn't matter</i>
<i>when it happened.</i>

785
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,786
<i>Okay? It just matters</i>
<i>that we get them both help.</i>

786

<i>-Let me just...</i>
<i>-Misty, not right now.</i>

<i>All right. Can everyone just...</i>

<i>Laura Lee,</i>

789
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,918
<i>you can't do this.</i>

<i>No. I-It's not even</i>
<i>close to safe.</i>

791
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,631
<i>There is no "safe" anymore,</i>
<i>Coach Scott.</i>

792

<i>It's going to be winter soon.</i>

<i>I'm still the only adult here,</i>

00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,357
<i>so, no.</i>

798
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,525

<i>I'd like to start the meeting</i>

<i>I really need</i>
<i>to talk to you about,</i>

<i>Please?</i>

<i>So, you remember that guy...</i>

<i>[chuckles] ...that I used to</i>
<i>always talk about?</i>

827

<i>ruled it a suicide,</i>

<i>And why is that, Natalie?</i>

835
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:38,235
<i>Because he made me a promise.</i>

836
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,571
<i>And when I was on</i>

00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:06,305
<i>I-I know I'm a liar.</i>

845
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:09,349
<i>He always kept his word.</i>

846
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:11,727
<i>Always.</i>

847
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:16,648
<i>I know he didn't kill himself.</i>

848
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:24,656
<i>For once, I think you're</i>
<i>actually telling me the truth.</i>

849
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:28,577
<i>I need your help, Suze.</i>

850
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,038
<i>Somebody closed</i>

851
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,290
<i>Travis's bank account</i>

852
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:34,875
<i>after he died,</i>

853
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:38,253
<i>and I need to find out who, or</i>

854
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,880
<i>-where that money went...</i>
<i>-I'm sorry. I just,</i>

855
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:42,007
<i>I can't give out</i>
<i>personal account information,</i>

856
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,968
<i>unless you're family.</i>
<i>I mean, I could get fired.</i>

857
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:47,971
<i>I thought you might say that.</i>

858
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:50,891
<i>[chuckles] Well...</i>

859
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:54,228
<i>I guess I'm gonna have</i>
<i>to call the bank then</i>

860
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:55,771
<i>and tell them</i>

861
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,481
<i>how you and I</i>

862
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:59,817
<i>used to feed our habits</i>

863
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:02,486
<i>by selling your customers'</i>

<i>personal information</i>

865
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:07,199
<i>to identity thieves.</i>

866
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:11,161
<i>I think they'd be</i>
<i>really interested to know that.</i>

867
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:16,416
<i>Or they could just be</i>
<i>really impressed</i>

868
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,960
<i>by your personal growth.</i>

00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:20,128

00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:24,550
<i>I wish I'd never</i>
<i>fucking met you.</i>

00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:42,067
<i>slow, tense music </i>

872
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:50,868
<i>Did you really</i>
<i>have to tell everyone?</i>

873
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:53,871
<i>[scoffs] I mean,</i>
<i>how could I not?</i>

874
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:57,165
<i>Shauna, we have</i>
<i>the chance to get you</i>

875
00:47:57,207 --> 00:48:00,878
<i>and the baby out of here.</i>

876
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:03,338
<i>That's all that matters. It's...</i>

877
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,257
<i>It's not really the time</i>
<i>to be keeping secrets.</i>

878
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:55,641
<i>[Taissa]</i>
<i>After the crash,</i>

879
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:58,769
<i>when we were stuck out there,</i>
<i>I started sleepwalking.</i>

880
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:02,397
<i>A symptom of the trauma,</i>
<i>I guess.</i>

881
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:05,901
<i>Once we were rescued,</i>
<i>it just... just stopped.</i>

882
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,362
<i>But with the stress</i>

883
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:10,906
<i>of the campaign,</i>
<i>and everything that's been</i>

884
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,116
<i>going on, um,</i>

885
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:15,369
<i>it started happening again.</i>

886
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,995
<i>No, uh...</i>

887
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,580
<i>It's not just happening,</i>

888
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:21,166
<i>I'm doing it, and it, and it,</i>
<i>and it fucking scares me</i>

889
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,418
<i>because the last time, I...</i>

890
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,463
<i>I... Um...</i>

891
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,717
<i>I think I may have been the one</i>

892
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:33,470
<i>to let Biscuit out of the house.</i>

893
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,140
<i>-[sighs]</i>
<i>-I'm sorry.</i>

894
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:41,144
<i>It's okay.</i>

895
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:43,313
<i>-It's okay, baby.</i>
<i>-[sniffles]</i>

896
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,857
<i>-It's okay. I know, it's okay.</i>
<i>-No. [crying]</i>

897
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:49,736
<i>It's okay.</i>
<i>It's okay. It's okay.</i>

00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:51,863
<i>Baby, baby, baby.</i>

<i>Okay? It's okay.</i>

900
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,576
<i>We will get you help.</i>
<i>Whatever you need, okay?</i>

901
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:57,786
<i>Mm.</i>

902
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,621
<i>And we can, um,</i>

<i>I don't know,</i>

904
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,583
<i>What I really need</i>
<i>is for you and Sammy</i>

905
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,627
<i>to go stay at your mom's house</i>
<i>for a little while.</i>

906
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:08,005
<i>What? Why?</i>

907
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:09,339
<i>I-I just think it would be</i>

908
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:10,924
<i>better for everybody involved</i>

909
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,676
<i>-if you and...</i>
<i>-No, Taissa, Taissa,</i>

910
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:14,261

<i>-Simone...</i>

<i>I don't think</i>
<i>I'm making myself clear.</i>

914
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:22,185
<i>You don't understand. I'm afraid</i>
<i>I'm going to hurt you...</i>

915

<i>[sniffles]</i>
<i>...or Sammy.</i>
