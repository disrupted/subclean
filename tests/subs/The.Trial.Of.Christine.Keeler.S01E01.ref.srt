1
00:00:19,295 --> 00:00:21,711
I'm an ordinary sort of person.

2
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:27,682
It may be hard to believe,
but I've never longed
for the spotlight.

3
00:00:27,717 --> 00:00:29,581
- Christine!

4
00:00:29,615 --> 00:00:31,445
Do you have any comments?

5
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:34,275
- Just a word or two!
- Christine!

6
00:00:35,794 --> 00:00:39,108
But somehow the spotlight found me.

7
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,702
How can you know when your story begins?

8
00:01:03,442 --> 00:01:07,446
Like any girl my age,
I'd always dreamt
of meeting Prince Charming.

9
00:01:10,691 --> 00:01:12,693
Then I met John Profumo.

10
00:01:18,181 --> 00:01:20,839
John was never Prince Charming.

11
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:22,565
I knew that from the very beginning.

12
00:01:25,292 --> 00:01:26,500
Oh, shit!

13
00:01:44,242 --> 00:01:46,692
You're 19 years old.

14
00:01:46,727 --> 00:01:48,832
Innocent, guilty.

15
00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:51,525
- Shit!

16
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:55,667
How can one girl
have the power to bring
a whole world tumbling down?

17
00:01:55,701 --> 00:01:57,358
Oh, Christine.

18
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:02,329
Christine!

19
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:43,887
Did you take my fags?

20
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:46,649
Johnny?

21
00:02:52,758 --> 00:02:54,174
Excuse me.

22
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,632
- Hmm.
- Oh!

23
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:07,359
Sorry, we're closed.

24
00:03:07,394 --> 00:03:09,534
I'm supposed to be at this toothpaste thing.

25
00:03:09,568 --> 00:03:12,226
Johnny! We need the money.

26
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,204
Oh, Christ! I swear,
if you ladder my stockings,
I'll kill you.

27
00:03:25,515 --> 00:03:27,586
For fresher cleaner teeth

28
00:03:27,621 --> 00:03:30,762
and minty bright all-day freshness.

29
00:03:30,796 --> 00:03:32,419
- What?

30
00:03:32,453 --> 00:03:33,661
"Minty bright freshness."

31
00:03:33,696 --> 00:03:37,044
Minty bright all-day freshness

32
00:03:37,078 --> 00:03:39,943
Bloody hell, I've not even
brushed my teeth, you know.

33
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:42,843
Oh, I am gonna be so late.

34
00:03:42,877 --> 00:03:44,914
You're always late, woman.

35
00:03:44,948 --> 00:03:47,986
Hmm... Your fault.

36
00:04:00,964 --> 00:04:02,449
Shit.

37
00:04:07,005 --> 00:04:08,662
Men are such fools.

38
00:04:08,696 --> 00:04:11,009
- But I like them.

39
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:12,873
And they seem to like me.

40
00:04:14,323 --> 00:04:16,842
If a man finds a girl attractive,

41
00:04:16,877 --> 00:04:18,810
is she the one to blame?

42
00:04:25,126 --> 00:04:29,372
- No butter, Mandy.
- I know, I know.

43
00:04:29,407 --> 00:04:30,925
It's Velvet.

44
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,583
Forget Velvet, I'm not calling you bloody Velvet.

45
00:04:35,654 --> 00:04:37,000
Where'd that bread come from?

46
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:39,313
The shop.

47
00:04:50,738 --> 00:04:52,671
Sixteen, eighteen...

48
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:56,019
Twenty four slices in a loaf.
There should be twenty two left.

49
00:04:56,054 --> 00:04:59,333
Maybe they're cutting down.
Making it smaller,
but charging the same.

50
00:04:59,368 --> 00:05:01,542
Anyway, I had toast for breakfast.

51
00:05:01,577 --> 00:05:04,925
- This is yesterday's, isn't it?
- No, I had toast, two slices.

52
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:07,790
Piss off, Mandy!
You can lie to me all you like,
but I'm not eating this--

53
00:05:07,824 --> 00:05:09,723
- I had toast!

54
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:15,107
Fine. You can starve for all I care.

55
00:05:15,142 --> 00:05:16,902
The world's about to end anyway.

56
00:05:21,838 --> 00:05:23,357
Miserable old git.

57
00:05:23,392 --> 00:05:25,980
I've had it up to here with him, Chris.

58
00:05:26,015 --> 00:05:29,639
I mean, today, of all days...

59
00:05:29,674 --> 00:05:31,710
Why? What's today?

60
00:05:31,745 --> 00:05:34,541
- It's my eighteenth!
- Oh, course it is.

61
00:05:34,575 --> 00:05:36,370
Happy birthday, doll.

62
00:05:36,405 --> 00:05:37,958
And look what he gives me!

63
00:05:41,444 --> 00:05:45,414
- Oh! It must be five hundred?
- A thousand.

64
00:05:45,448 --> 00:05:49,625
Would it have killed him
to splash out sixpence extra
on a bit of wrapping paper?

65
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:53,042
Peter's Peter. He gave you the Jag last year.

66
00:05:53,076 --> 00:05:54,664
Maybe he's run out of ideas.

67
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:56,148
He's run out of something.

68
00:05:56,183 --> 00:05:58,530
- Sweetheart?
- Full English, please.

69
00:05:58,565 --> 00:06:01,982
- Mand?
- Erm, coffee, please.

70
00:06:04,087 --> 00:06:05,710
Eighteen's not that old.

71
00:06:05,744 --> 00:06:07,643
I just want to have a bit of fun, you know?

72
00:06:07,677 --> 00:06:10,508
You could have a lot of fun for a thousand quid.

73
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:14,822
I was thinking
of having my nose done.
You know, Harley Street job.

74
00:06:14,857 --> 00:06:17,411
The photographers say it kinks out on this side.

75
00:06:18,585 --> 00:06:20,414
- Looks fine to me.
- Really?

76
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:22,002
There you go, love.

77
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,179
Thanks, doll. I'm skitters.

78
00:06:27,214 --> 00:06:28,802
Keep the change!

79
00:06:30,597 --> 00:06:31,736
Thank you.

80
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,707
Did you go to your audition dressed like that?

81
00:06:37,742 --> 00:06:39,606
With a ladder in your stocking

82
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,953
It was for toothpaste,
they weren't looking at my legs.

83
00:06:41,987 --> 00:06:45,508
They always look at your legs.

84
00:06:45,543 --> 00:06:48,649
Christine Margaret Keeler.
You didn't go, did you?

85
00:06:48,684 --> 00:06:51,997
Well... why not?

86
00:06:52,032 --> 00:06:54,897
That was a really good opportunity, Chris.

87
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:57,002
Good day to you, ladies.

88
00:06:57,037 --> 00:06:58,728
Oh, bloody hell.

89
00:06:58,763 --> 00:07:00,868
Can't really stop, Lucky,
were in a bit of a rush.

90
00:07:00,903 --> 00:07:03,768
- Going to see somebody, is it?
- It's none of your business.

91
00:07:03,802 --> 00:07:05,873
You think I can't follow you everywhere you go?

92
00:07:05,908 --> 00:07:07,737
Leave her alone!

93
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:09,774
You're shacked up
with Edgecombe now,
you little whore!

94
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:12,742
Yeah, maybe I am!

95
00:07:12,777 --> 00:07:15,607
- Oh!
- You bastard!

96
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:21,786
See what you make me do!

97
00:07:24,547 --> 00:07:27,550
Bloody hell, Chris, are you okay?

98
00:07:27,585 --> 00:07:29,828
I'm fine.

99
00:07:29,863 --> 00:07:32,797
- I'm gonna call the police,
this can't keep happening.
- No, no.

100
00:07:37,836 --> 00:07:39,597
Let's go to Stephen's. Come on.

101
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:48,537
Dr. Stephen Ward. He was always there to save me.

102
00:07:48,571 --> 00:07:50,815
And there never seemed a price to pay.

103
00:07:51,747 --> 00:07:52,955
Or so I thought.

104
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:54,681
Open your mouth, little baby.

105
00:07:57,649 --> 00:07:58,685
Little wider.

106
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:02,999
Mm... You'll live.

107
00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:05,243
The swelling might come up in a few hours.

108
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,694
I think I have some arnica somewhere.

109
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:09,281
I told her to go to the police!

110
00:08:09,316 --> 00:08:13,320
It's fine. Lucky'll get over it.

111
00:08:13,354 --> 00:08:15,633
He must have just heard about me and Johnny.

112
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:19,775
Chrissie, darling,
on this at least
Lucky and I see eye to eye.

113
00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:23,295
The last thing you need
in your complicated little life

114
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,643
is another low-life Jamaican boyfriend.

115
00:08:25,677 --> 00:08:29,163
He's not Jamaican! He's from Antigua.

116
00:08:29,198 --> 00:08:32,546
Johnny can't stick Jamaicans.
And he's nothing like Lucky.

117
00:08:33,961 --> 00:08:35,169
You're just prejudiced.

118
00:08:35,204 --> 00:08:38,172
Oh, no, you know it's not that.

119
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:40,899
I just... I worry about you, that's all.

120
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,077
Nice arse!

121
00:08:46,111 --> 00:08:47,216
Thank you.

122
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,666
Anyone we know?

123
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,357
Strictly professional, little baby.

124
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:52,014
A man has his needs.

125
00:08:52,048 --> 00:08:53,878
I'll pop to the launderette later.

126
00:08:53,912 --> 00:08:56,156
It's just till I sort myself out.

127
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,261
You can stay here as long as you like, darling.

128
00:08:58,296 --> 00:09:00,091
That is if we're spared.

129
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:03,025
- Spared?
- Khrushchev's missiles.

130
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:05,648
Cuba, little baby.

131
00:09:07,443 --> 00:09:10,170
- The Russians?
- Oh. Bloody Russians.

132
00:09:10,204 --> 00:09:12,724
- Is ten alright, Mand?
- Help yourself.

133
00:09:13,932 --> 00:09:17,280
But you need to start taking
your modelling seriously,
Christine.

134
00:09:17,315 --> 00:09:18,419
Tell her, Stephen.

135
00:09:19,697 --> 00:09:21,284
Talking of Russians.

136
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:29,258
Bloody hell, Eugene,
why don't you just leave
your toothbrush here?

137
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:31,156
Uhm.

138
00:09:31,191 --> 00:09:34,643
MI5 may have been watching Captain Ivanov,

139
00:09:34,677 --> 00:09:36,817
but to me he was
just another one
of Stephen's friends.

140
00:09:38,992 --> 00:09:41,788
I had no idea what
an extraordinary life
I was leading.

141
00:09:41,822 --> 00:09:45,377
But then, Mr. Profumo was the extraordinary one.

142
00:09:45,412 --> 00:09:47,034
- Not me.

143
00:09:47,069 --> 00:09:48,311
Jolly good.

144
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:53,938
Salute.

145
00:09:59,668 --> 00:10:02,463
- The lunch is always very good.
- It had better be.

146
00:10:02,498 --> 00:10:05,018
Terribly sorry, sir.

147
00:10:05,052 --> 00:10:07,986
My mother is a tremendous fan, Miss Hobson,

148
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:09,712
she simply would never forgive me.

149
00:10:09,747 --> 00:10:10,886
Of course.

150
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,164
I go by Mrs. Profumo these days,

151
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:15,131
but let's not disappoint your mother.

152
00:10:17,513 --> 00:10:18,445
Thank you.

153
00:10:18,479 --> 00:10:19,688
Thank you.

154
00:10:23,243 --> 00:10:26,798
I sometimes think I should
become Prime Minister
just to trump you.

155
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,180
They'd still ask for my autograph.

156
00:10:29,214 --> 00:10:31,389
- Oh, they'd ask for mine first.

157
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:32,701
Mr. Profumo.

158
00:10:32,735 --> 00:10:34,461
- Yes.
- Daily Mirror, sir

159
00:10:34,495 --> 00:10:37,257
Anything to say about the Cuba situation?

160
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:40,018
Yes, the Prime Minister is absolutely right.

161
00:10:40,053 --> 00:10:42,469
We cannot bow to bullying from the Soviets!

162
00:10:42,503 --> 00:10:44,713
Shall we?

163
00:10:44,747 --> 00:10:47,025
Everyone was worrying about the bomb,

164
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,683
when they should have been worrying about me.

165
00:10:52,306 --> 00:10:54,723
I was much more dangerous than Russia.

166
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:57,242
Oh, shit!

167
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,007
Ah, Christine.

168
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,735
A towel, Jack.

169
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:09,047
Give the poor girl that towel.

170
00:11:09,082 --> 00:11:10,083
Of course.

171
00:11:11,878 --> 00:11:13,845
Right you are.

172
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:18,091
Come on!

173
00:11:19,989 --> 00:11:20,956
Did you see them?

174
00:11:23,337 --> 00:11:27,031
You're an absolute bugger.
You knew I was going for a swim!

175
00:11:27,065 --> 00:11:28,998
Naked as nature intended.

176
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:30,759
Poor Jack didn't know where to look.

177
00:11:30,793 --> 00:11:33,278
He knew exactly where to bloody look!

178
00:11:33,313 --> 00:11:37,317
I suppose it saved me
from introducing you formally
to Mr. Profumo.

179
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:40,389
Profumo... Is he foreign?

180
00:11:40,423 --> 00:11:43,323
He's the coming man, little baby.

181
00:11:43,357 --> 00:11:45,394
Might be our next Prime Minister.

182
00:11:45,428 --> 00:11:46,464
Oh.

183
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:51,780
His wife's very beautiful.
Even more than at the pictures.

184
00:11:51,814 --> 00:11:53,851
She's stunning...

185
00:11:53,885 --> 00:11:55,818
for a woman of her age.

186
00:11:55,853 --> 00:11:58,062
But she is her age.

187
00:11:58,096 --> 00:12:02,169
And I'd say Mr. Profumo only has eyes for you.

188
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,380
Oh!

189
00:12:31,026 --> 00:12:33,131
Here's the thing.

190
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:37,446
It's all very well
building Profumo up to tear
the Prime Minister down,

191
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,069
but we don't want the Tories in at all, do we?

192
00:12:40,104 --> 00:12:43,797
I thought you said
the film star angle
goes down well with the punters.

193
00:12:45,247 --> 00:12:49,009
Like strawberries and cream,
along with the war hero angle.

194
00:12:49,044 --> 00:12:50,562
That's the trouble.

195
00:12:50,597 --> 00:12:52,806
We're making them look like the Golden Couple.

196
00:12:53,945 --> 00:12:55,602
Fortunately for us,

197
00:12:56,983 --> 00:12:58,812
nobody's perfect, are they?

198
00:13:01,608 --> 00:13:03,575
Would you like me to have a sniff?

199
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:09,167
Sniff away, Alan, my lad, see if anything stinks.

200
00:13:09,202 --> 00:13:12,067
If the Tories are thinking
of getting rid of the PM

201
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:15,277
and replacing him with the fifth Baron Profumo,

202
00:13:17,175 --> 00:13:20,040
public has a right to know the kind of man he is.

203
00:13:27,082 --> 00:13:28,428
Ah, ah!

204
00:13:28,462 --> 00:13:31,293
So this is what you've been up to, Jack!

205
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:34,261
"Stands firm." What the hell are they implying?

206
00:13:34,296 --> 00:13:37,092
Ah, that you're solid on this missile nonsense

207
00:13:37,126 --> 00:13:39,266
and you've got the balls for the top job.

208
00:13:39,301 --> 00:13:42,269
Ha! If the old man could
ever be persuaded to retire.

209
00:13:42,304 --> 00:13:45,307
Yeah. He seems determined to drop in harness.

210
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:46,549
We may have to shoot him.

211
00:13:47,688 --> 00:13:49,552
Well, keep up the good work!

212
00:13:51,037 --> 00:13:53,971
- You look smashing.
- Hmm... Really?

213
00:13:54,005 --> 00:13:56,180
I'd give you a job.

214
00:13:56,214 --> 00:13:58,389
- And the other...

215
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:02,048
- Disgusting.
- What did you say?

216
00:14:02,082 --> 00:14:03,946
Hey, Christine. Don't let it get to you.

217
00:14:03,981 --> 00:14:05,396
Stony-faced old cow
should mind her own
fucking business!

218
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:08,088
And we should be minding ours.

219
00:14:08,123 --> 00:14:11,091
I've heard a lot worse, believe me.

220
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:19,686
- Good luck, doll!
- Hmm.

221
00:14:27,763 --> 00:14:30,524
What about that two pounds I gave you?

222
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:33,700
I told-- Mum? Mum, listen!

223
00:14:35,357 --> 00:14:37,428
I can't give it to you straight away, but...

224
00:14:37,462 --> 00:14:40,258
I mean Americans
are putting themselves
all over the world.

225
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:42,467
- Even in Communist soils!
- Just things.

226
00:14:42,502 --> 00:14:47,438
They want me for this advert
on the telly... toothpaste.

227
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:51,580
I know things are tight!

228
00:14:51,614 --> 00:14:52,995
It's your government.

229
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,617
I'm doing everything I can.

230
00:14:54,652 --> 00:14:56,654
...being together with the Americans...

231
00:14:56,688 --> 00:15:00,382
Give him ten bob now
and tell him he can have
the rest next week!

232
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:03,281
- Cuba is the same as it's happening in Germany.

233
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:05,628
That was half a crown at least!

234
00:15:05,663 --> 00:15:07,699
I'll owe you.

235
00:15:07,734 --> 00:15:11,738
God, my mum! It's like
feeding shillings
into the bloody gas meter,

236
00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:13,188
but it never gets warm.

237
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:17,399
- I think they're handmade shoes.
- What?

238
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:19,677
Mr. Eddowes.

239
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:23,129
- Is he one of Stephen's patients?
- Yeah.

240
00:15:23,163 --> 00:15:27,167
Solicitor or something.
He owns a few restaurants too.

241
00:15:27,202 --> 00:15:29,100
It's clearly a...

242
00:15:29,135 --> 00:15:30,584
Be my guest.

243
00:15:30,619 --> 00:15:33,173
But I thought you'd had it with old blokes.

244
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:36,452
I like them. I do!

245
00:15:36,487 --> 00:15:38,627
As long as they're presentable.

246
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:42,079
"Presentable"... all the way to the bloody bank.

247
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,082
I couldn't agree more.

248
00:15:45,116 --> 00:15:47,325
Playing missiles instead of money.

249
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,500
Now you sound more like them than ever.

250
00:15:49,534 --> 00:15:53,504
The game is not important, it's how you play it.

251
00:15:53,538 --> 00:15:55,747
You're a lucky man, Ward!

252
00:15:55,782 --> 00:15:59,061
My dear Michael, there is no such thing as luck.

253
00:15:59,096 --> 00:16:01,270
- Ah!

254
00:16:01,305 --> 00:16:05,585
Only an alertness
to the opportunities
life has to offer you.

255
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:08,553
...a Soviet gesture.

256
00:16:13,524 --> 00:16:15,008
I'll be off.

257
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:19,116
You know you can always
bunk with me if you like,
little baby.

258
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,981
Nah, Johnny'll be wondering where I got to.

259
00:16:23,154 --> 00:16:25,674
You got five bob for the cab?

260
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:26,744
Help yourself.

261
00:16:30,437 --> 00:16:35,270
At the risk of sounding like a broken record,

262
00:16:35,304 --> 00:16:38,549
you could do a lot better
for yourself than Johnny.

263
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:42,173
Thanks... Dad.

264
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:47,316
Christine, look at you.
Your face is your fortune.

265
00:16:47,351 --> 00:16:49,836
Notting Hill is not doing you any favors.

266
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,563
At your age,
with your connections--
my connections.

267
00:16:52,597 --> 00:16:55,669
I'm not Mandy.

268
00:16:55,704 --> 00:16:57,430
All's I want is a bit of a laugh

269
00:16:57,464 --> 00:16:59,363
and enough spare to keep my mum off my back.

270
00:16:59,397 --> 00:17:02,711
Eh. "All". Not "All's".

271
00:17:02,745 --> 00:17:04,333
"All".

272
00:17:04,368 --> 00:17:06,094
Eddowes, though...

273
00:17:07,302 --> 00:17:10,132
Cash to burn and an eye for a pretty girl.

274
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,342
You know the drill.

275
00:17:14,481 --> 00:17:17,553
You can have your cake and eat it.

276
00:17:17,588 --> 00:17:19,762
You never eat it.

277
00:17:19,797 --> 00:17:22,351
Just like watching everyone
else stuffing themselves.

278
00:17:22,386 --> 00:17:25,734
Crumbs everywhere.

279
00:17:25,768 --> 00:17:28,185
Kinky sod.

280
00:17:28,219 --> 00:17:29,634
Hmm.

281
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:34,708
I have to fancy them, Stephen.

282
00:17:34,743 --> 00:17:37,159
Either I do, or I don't.

283
00:17:37,194 --> 00:17:40,266
You know if you are really
short of cash you can
always go back to Murray's.

284
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,888
Stick it up your jumper!

285
00:18:57,619 --> 00:18:59,172
Good girl, thank you.

286
00:19:05,972 --> 00:19:08,388
Can I pour you more Champagne, sir?

287
00:19:09,217 --> 00:19:11,736
That stuff bears as much resemblance to Champagne

288
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:13,773
as I do to Rock Hudson.

289
00:19:15,223 --> 00:19:16,707
But yes please.

290
00:19:20,607 --> 00:19:22,471
What are you doing later?

291
00:19:23,852 --> 00:19:25,785
It's already later.

292
00:19:25,819 --> 00:19:27,821
I mean after the club shuts.

293
00:19:28,995 --> 00:19:30,686
Having fun.

294
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:32,550
Hm, splendid!

295
00:19:35,622 --> 00:19:36,934
And you?

296
00:19:43,941 --> 00:19:47,462
You know, I could introduce you
to a lot more fun.

297
00:20:14,661 --> 00:20:15,766
Murray's, guv.

298
00:20:17,595 --> 00:20:19,632
It's a topless cabaret.

299
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:23,498
One of the dancers
was very friendly
with Mr. Profumo, apparently.

300
00:20:23,532 --> 00:20:26,639
- Have you spoken to her?
- They said she finished there months ago.

301
00:20:26,673 --> 00:20:29,297
She can't have vanished
into thin air.
Did you get a name?

302
00:20:29,331 --> 00:20:31,057
Christine Keeler.

303
00:20:31,091 --> 00:20:34,336
Christine Keeler.

304
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,617
I want this one, Alan.

305
00:20:39,652 --> 00:20:40,963
You need to find her.

306
00:20:42,482 --> 00:20:43,932
Cherchez le bint.

307
00:20:52,699 --> 00:20:56,669
Stephen's right,
you've got a lovely place
here, Mr. Eddowes.

308
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,429
Michael, please.

309
00:20:59,948 --> 00:21:04,677
I was so delighted that
you accepted my invitation.

310
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,508
I thought perhaps you wouldn't.

311
00:21:10,648 --> 00:21:11,580
Let me.

312
00:21:24,697 --> 00:21:26,837
That's rather smart.

313
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:28,321
It was a present.

314
00:21:28,356 --> 00:21:30,323
From an admirer, no doubt.

315
00:21:31,635 --> 00:21:35,742
- Jack Profumo actually.
- Profumo?

316
00:21:35,777 --> 00:21:37,365
The War Minister?

317
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,402
He's something in government, isn't he?

318
00:21:41,714 --> 00:21:43,716
Something important, anyway.

319
00:21:54,727 --> 00:21:56,142
Christine...

320
00:21:56,176 --> 00:21:59,904
Thank you ever so much for lunch, Michael.

321
00:21:59,939 --> 00:22:01,596
You're very sweet.

322
00:22:06,877 --> 00:22:08,741
Darby and Joan those two...

323
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:13,849
Isn't Ward worried the Russian chap's a spy?

324
00:22:13,884 --> 00:22:15,057
Eugene?

325
00:22:16,196 --> 00:22:18,371
Stephen says it doesn't matter because...

326
00:22:18,406 --> 00:22:21,547
Well, because Wotsit's keeping an eye on him.

327
00:22:21,581 --> 00:22:23,480
They listen in on the phones as well.

328
00:22:23,514 --> 00:22:24,929
MI5?

329
00:22:26,414 --> 00:22:27,829
Makes him feel important.

330
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,866
See you later, Michael.

331
00:22:37,597 --> 00:22:38,874
Christine! Hear me.

332
00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:40,738
- Stay away from me!
- No, no, listen.

333
00:22:40,773 --> 00:22:43,569
I just want to apologize
for our misunderstanding.

334
00:22:43,603 --> 00:22:45,053
I wasn't thinking straight.

335
00:22:45,087 --> 00:22:47,158
You're not right in the bloody head, that's why!

336
00:22:47,193 --> 00:22:48,884
Mr. Eddowes, can you get me out of here please?

337
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:50,127
This really isn't...

338
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:52,405
Allow me to explain myself.

339
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,234
I don't wanna talk to you, Lucky!

340
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:56,616
We're not together anymore. We're finished!

341
00:22:56,651 --> 00:22:58,791
Listen, Christine, please. I just want to...

342
00:22:58,825 --> 00:23:00,793
Lucky, all right, you're not
doing yourself any favors.

343
00:23:00,827 --> 00:23:03,140
Edgecombe is no good, you need to know that.

344
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:05,418
He sleeps with every girl he meets.

345
00:23:05,453 --> 00:23:07,696
He's twice the bloke
you'll ever be,
so piss off out my business!

346
00:23:07,731 --> 00:23:09,457
No, listen, I'm just trying to apologize.

347
00:23:09,491 --> 00:23:12,425
- Drive!
- I'm trying to be helpful, Christine!

348
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,875
Get off of me, man.

349
00:23:21,814 --> 00:23:23,229
Lucky says it's me.

350
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:26,439
I drive him crazy.

351
00:23:26,474 --> 00:23:30,029
Got that right.

352
00:23:30,063 --> 00:23:31,996
You drive me crazy.

353
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:35,931
Man's got a screw loose.

354
00:23:37,243 --> 00:23:38,589
Everyone knows that.

355
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:43,525
I should get a gun to keep me safe.

356
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,976
- Only thing he understands.
- Hmm.

357
00:23:47,287 --> 00:23:48,806
I'll keep you safe.

358
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:51,257
Will you?

359
00:23:53,293 --> 00:23:57,125
Every way I know how.

360
00:24:05,271 --> 00:24:07,825
Are you sure you didn't get that job?

361
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,138
Yeah.

362
00:24:10,172 --> 00:24:12,278
They said they weren't hiring,

363
00:24:12,312 --> 00:24:15,557
which is what they always
say before you see
a white guy walk up

364
00:24:15,592 --> 00:24:17,214
and shake their hand.

365
00:24:22,046 --> 00:24:24,014
Do you know anyone who could get hold of a gun?

366
00:24:26,016 --> 00:24:28,570
You got the wrong man, girl.

367
00:24:28,605 --> 00:24:31,159
John Edgecombe is a man of peace.

368
00:24:31,193 --> 00:24:35,922
Peace, and music, and love...

369
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:43,067
You sure about that?

370
00:24:54,631 --> 00:24:57,254
I'm not certain this is a good idea, Stephen.

371
00:24:58,566 --> 00:25:02,570
You know Mandy, always keen on a new experience.

372
00:25:02,604 --> 00:25:06,021
No. I meant putting Arran and Ivanov together.

373
00:25:06,056 --> 00:25:08,610
Perhaps we should leave
politics to the politicians?

374
00:25:13,615 --> 00:25:15,721
Obviously, you will get rid
of Mandy before lunch.

375
00:25:15,755 --> 00:25:19,241
I wouldn't dream
of bringing her to the house,
Bill, you know that.

376
00:25:20,657 --> 00:25:24,592
Mutually assured destruction.

377
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:27,215
The world is on the brink of nuclear war,

378
00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:30,563
and Lord Arran has the ear of the Prime Minister.

379
00:25:34,015 --> 00:25:37,743
I can mention your idea to the PM, Doctor Ward.

380
00:25:39,641 --> 00:25:43,680
Though I'm not
quite clear what a Russian
naval attaché is doing,

381
00:25:43,714 --> 00:25:46,268
attempting to set up peace talks.

382
00:25:48,063 --> 00:25:50,031
Well, not everyone in the Kremlin

383
00:25:50,065 --> 00:25:54,311
is as hell bent on war as Krushchev, my lord.

384
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:57,383
And my friendship with Eugene

385
00:25:57,417 --> 00:26:01,145
puts me in a rather unique
position, you might say.

386
00:26:04,701 --> 00:26:07,600
- Bloody hell!
- Oh, bugger.

387
00:26:07,635 --> 00:26:09,809
Careful, miss.

388
00:26:09,844 --> 00:26:11,949
- Sorry.
- I'll take that.

389
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,406
This Arran didn't take me seriously, I can tell.

390
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,030
Eugene, Lord Arran is an English aristocrat.

391
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:27,378
He's spent a lifetime
perfecting the same expression
for everything,

392
00:26:27,413 --> 00:26:30,623
whether he takes it seriously or not.

393
00:26:30,658 --> 00:26:33,143
What do you think Eton's for?

394
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:36,146
You didn't go to Eton, my friend.

395
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,838
These public schools that are in fact private...

396
00:26:38,873 --> 00:26:42,083
I went to public school, just not Eton.

397
00:26:42,117 --> 00:26:47,088
Or Harrow, or Charterhouse,
or Winchester, or Sherborne.

398
00:26:47,122 --> 00:26:50,091
Sherborne is practically a minor public school...

399
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:52,714
Ah, good, I've caught you!

400
00:26:52,749 --> 00:26:56,476
Bill's in the bath,
but he's suffering I can tell.
His sacroiliac's out.

401
00:26:56,511 --> 00:26:59,963
If you can spare the time
do pop along, would you?
After supper.

402
00:26:59,997 --> 00:27:03,449
I can always spare you the time, Lady Astor!

403
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:08,661
You've met, I think. Captain Ivanov.

404
00:27:08,696 --> 00:27:12,389
I imagine you already know
Lady Astor was
a celebrated mannequin

405
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:14,080
before she met her husband.

406
00:27:14,115 --> 00:27:16,842
Well, we all retire when we marry!

407
00:27:16,876 --> 00:27:19,120
Not from everything, I hope.

408
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:25,022
Forgive me, Captain,
we're just about
to beat the gong.

409
00:27:28,508 --> 00:27:30,959
You didn't get an invitation for supper, ah?

410
00:27:33,755 --> 00:27:40,072
I fear my presence reminds
Lady Astor of Bill's
bachelor days.

411
00:27:40,106 --> 00:27:43,489
Beans on toast at the cottage,
old chap! Food of the gods.

412
00:27:43,523 --> 00:27:47,217
Communism, my friend. Communism.

413
00:27:58,297 --> 00:28:00,713
High society.

414
00:28:00,748 --> 00:28:04,855
Stephen couldn't resist
a toff any more
than he could a pretty face.

415
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:07,789
He saw himself as so much more
than just a doctor.

416
00:28:09,757 --> 00:28:12,449
And with his finger in all those pies,

417
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:16,798
is it any surprise MI5
were beginning to wonder
whose side he was on?

418
00:28:22,286 --> 00:28:26,912
Doctor Ward, our society osteopath.

419
00:28:26,946 --> 00:28:29,569
The Foreign Office passed it on.

420
00:28:29,604 --> 00:28:32,469
Always knew Ward was
a loose cannon, but really...

421
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:36,162
He's been on to Lord Arran
trying to set up a peace summit,
here in London.

422
00:28:36,197 --> 00:28:39,131
Seems to think he can solve the Cuban Crisis.

423
00:28:39,165 --> 00:28:42,134
He's a back doctor for God's sake!

424
00:28:42,168 --> 00:28:46,034
Clearly he considers himself
something of an emissary
for the moderate Russian view.

425
00:28:46,069 --> 00:28:49,279
Emissary for cloud ruddy cuckoo land.

426
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:52,006
Peace!

427
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,905
That is the last thing
Comrade Ivanov's interested in.

428
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,391
Surely Ward sees it,
the man is a threat
to national security.

429
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,774
He's playing Ward like a Stradivarius.

430
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:06,296
If only we knew the tune.
You're continuing
to keep an eye?

431
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,987
Certainly am, sir.

432
00:29:08,022 --> 00:29:09,851
Ivanov's always at Wimpole Mews.

433
00:29:09,886 --> 00:29:12,198
And Ward keeps interesting company.

434
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:17,307
These popsies of his, that come and go,

435
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:19,619
I was wondering
if it would be useful
to have a word with them?

436
00:29:19,654 --> 00:29:22,001
Good God, whatever for?

437
00:29:22,036 --> 00:29:27,006
It's just, well,
they're clearly very close
to both Ward and Ivanov.

438
00:29:29,008 --> 00:29:32,425
And there's started to be
a certain amount of noise
about one of the girls

439
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,634
and the Secretary of State for War.

440
00:29:34,669 --> 00:29:38,846
Profumo? Well, we know about that.

441
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,090
It's done and dusted. Let's leave well alone.

442
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:45,266
Especially when we can see exactly what they are.

443
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,889
Window dressing.

444
00:29:47,924 --> 00:29:50,202
Parsley on the plate!

445
00:29:50,236 --> 00:29:53,136
These girls aren't going to cause any trouble.

446
00:29:57,002 --> 00:29:59,107
Boom, boom, boom.

447
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,594
Not bad for twenty quid, eh?

448
00:30:03,629 --> 00:30:05,113
Said it was from the war.

449
00:30:07,115 --> 00:30:09,324
- Stop pointing that thing!

450
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:12,155
It's not loaded. Yet.

451
00:30:13,432 --> 00:30:16,159
Oh, come on, let's go out!

452
00:30:16,193 --> 00:30:19,645
Can't remember the last time we went dancing.

453
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,337
Don't you fancy it, the all-nighters?

454
00:30:22,372 --> 00:30:25,340
Yeah, but not with this. No, no, come on.

455
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:30,242
Told you, didn't I?

456
00:30:30,276 --> 00:30:32,347
I'll look after you, darling.

457
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,292
- Ah!

458
00:30:46,327 --> 00:30:47,949
You looking good, no?

459
00:30:47,984 --> 00:30:50,262
You're not so bad yourself.

460
00:30:50,296 --> 00:30:52,298
Best looking girl in the west end.

461
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,682
- Come on!
- All right.

462
00:30:58,166 --> 00:30:59,616
Oh, flipping 'eck

463
00:31:13,492 --> 00:31:15,701
- Jack.
- Hmm.

464
00:31:15,735 --> 00:31:19,601
You haven't happened
to see this month's
Parliamentary Sketch, have you?

465
00:31:19,636 --> 00:31:21,189
God, no.

466
00:31:21,224 --> 00:31:23,433
Do I look like a dipsomaniac backbencher?

467
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:26,298
Perhaps you should take a look.

468
00:31:26,332 --> 00:31:29,715
- Ah.
- You see what they're implying?

469
00:31:29,749 --> 00:31:31,199
It's obtuse enough.

470
00:31:33,063 --> 00:31:35,721
"Who's spilled the beans to MI5?

471
00:31:35,755 --> 00:31:38,689
Because every time the card playing Russian spy

472
00:31:38,724 --> 00:31:41,209
arrived to admire the showgirl's curves,

473
00:31:41,244 --> 00:31:45,144
out of the back door slipped
the Honorable Member for X?"

474
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:47,664
I wouldn't call that obtuse.
It's you and Christine.

475
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:49,700
Nonsense, Bill. Absolute tosh.

476
00:31:49,735 --> 00:31:51,979
It was all over months ago.

477
00:31:53,428 --> 00:31:54,671
Christine who?

478
00:32:01,471 --> 00:32:04,750
- Bill looks awfully worried.
- He came out of the womb looking like that.

479
00:32:04,784 --> 00:32:06,200
Just Westminster gossip.

480
00:32:06,234 --> 00:32:09,168
I'll fill you in after supper.

481
00:32:29,223 --> 00:32:32,502
- Whoa!

482
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,163
You know I love you, right?

483
00:32:48,414 --> 00:32:52,004
Hey, don't turn round, but Lucky's here.

484
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:53,074
Don't!

485
00:32:55,594 --> 00:32:59,115
- You scared?
- No.

486
00:32:59,149 --> 00:33:01,117
He's the guy with the problem.

487
00:33:01,151 --> 00:33:04,120
Screw him! It's a free country.

488
00:33:07,226 --> 00:33:10,505
Hey, cool it. Cool it.

489
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,578
Got plenty of trouble
without you running around
finding it for me.

490
00:33:14,613 --> 00:33:16,063
I don't want trouble!

491
00:33:16,097 --> 00:33:17,581
If he doesn't like it, he can piss off!

492
00:33:17,616 --> 00:33:18,513
Come on!

493
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:22,862
Leave it, man, she's not worth it.

494
00:33:22,897 --> 00:33:24,554
No, man, it's disrespectful.

495
00:33:26,211 --> 00:33:28,316
- What was that, man?
- Listen, you know me!

496
00:33:28,351 --> 00:33:30,042
Leave it, leave it.

497
00:33:30,077 --> 00:33:32,148
Watch out.

498
00:33:32,182 --> 00:33:35,530
What you trying to do to me?
Rubbing my nose in it.

499
00:33:35,565 --> 00:33:37,153
You know everybody knows me here!

500
00:33:37,187 --> 00:33:39,258
That's enough, we don't want any trouble.

501
00:33:39,293 --> 00:33:41,157
- It has nothing to do with you.
- It has everything to do with me!

502
00:33:41,191 --> 00:33:43,504
- You're not so full of it now.
- Shut your fucking mouth.

503
00:33:43,538 --> 00:33:45,057
- I said leave it!
- What you gonna do?

504
00:33:45,092 --> 00:33:46,576
I swear to you, I got box your eyes out!

505
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:47,715
Swear what?

506
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:51,512
Come on!

507
00:33:51,546 --> 00:33:54,239
- Go on, you nasty little bitch.

508
00:33:54,273 --> 00:33:56,448
- Let me go!
- Leave her!

509
00:33:56,482 --> 00:33:58,277
Leave her alone!

510
00:33:58,312 --> 00:34:00,383
- Johnny!
- You try and play bad?

511
00:34:00,417 --> 00:34:02,178
What you gonna do?

512
00:34:02,212 --> 00:34:03,455
No, do it now.

513
00:34:03,489 --> 00:34:05,560
Go on now. What you got?

514
00:34:05,595 --> 00:34:07,079
- Bring it--
- Ah!

515
00:34:16,709 --> 00:34:18,504
He cut me.

516
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:20,886
Everybody see, he cut me!

517
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,716
You'll go to jail you! You mad bitch!

518
00:34:23,751 --> 00:34:26,167
He going to jail, both of you!

519
00:34:26,202 --> 00:34:28,169
Go on! Run!

520
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,242
Christine!

521
00:34:34,175 --> 00:34:35,832
Christine!

522
00:34:47,602 --> 00:34:49,604
- Jesus!

523
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,779
- What's that? Mandy!
- What?

524
00:34:51,813 --> 00:34:54,747
- Under the pillow.
- Oh, calm down.

525
00:34:54,782 --> 00:34:56,577
It's only a bit of Fruit and Nut, in case...

526
00:34:56,611 --> 00:34:59,166
- In case? What "in case"?
- The bomb.

527
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,513
If the warning goes off,
doesn't matter
if it gives me spots, does it?

528
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:06,449
- Marylebone 54643.
- Meshugganah!

529
00:35:06,483 --> 00:35:08,692
It's all kicked off with Lucky! Get Stephen!

530
00:35:08,727 --> 00:35:12,144
- No, Stephen's at the cottage.
- It's proper trouble, Mandy.

531
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:13,939
I'm gonna come over!

532
00:35:13,973 --> 00:35:18,461
No, listen, just lie low for a bit, okay?

533
00:35:18,495 --> 00:35:19,910
Peter's here.

534
00:35:19,945 --> 00:35:21,360
Talk to you tomorrow.

535
00:35:21,395 --> 00:35:22,810
Stephen will be back by then.

536
00:35:22,844 --> 00:35:24,777
- Mand--

537
00:35:24,812 --> 00:35:26,641
Shit!

538
00:35:29,817 --> 00:35:32,751
Christine, what you playing at?
We got to split! Now!

539
00:35:32,785 --> 00:35:34,442
Before the pigs come get me, come on!

540
00:35:34,477 --> 00:35:36,858
Why'd you have to cut him?

541
00:36:13,757 --> 00:36:16,691
Oh, little baby, what is it about you?

542
00:36:16,726 --> 00:36:19,625
Chaos seems to follow you wherever you go.

543
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:23,250
- It wasn't me who pulled a knife.
- No, I know.

544
00:36:23,284 --> 00:36:27,219
But I did hear your knight
in shining armor gave Lucky
a face full of stitches.

545
00:36:27,254 --> 00:36:29,359
Lucky started it.

546
00:36:29,394 --> 00:36:31,810
The police should be after him
just as much as Johnny!

547
00:36:31,844 --> 00:36:36,573
And any good solicitor will make
exactly that case, self-defense.

548
00:36:36,608 --> 00:36:39,956
If Lucky had provoked him, struck the first blow.

549
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,647
Of course he bloody did!

550
00:36:43,891 --> 00:36:46,238
I never thought Johnny
would pull a stunt like that.

551
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,517
Never thought he had it in him.

552
00:36:49,552 --> 00:36:52,486
Notting Hill, little baby. What did I say?

553
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,902
I'm not moving back to Wimpole Mews, Stephen.

554
00:36:54,936 --> 00:36:56,490
Did I even suggest it?

555
00:36:56,524 --> 00:36:59,078
I can't always come crying to you, can I?

556
00:36:59,113 --> 00:37:01,253
I've got to stand on my own two feet.

557
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:07,501
How much does a good solicitor cost, anyway?

558
00:37:09,468 --> 00:37:12,747
Little baby.

559
00:37:14,439 --> 00:37:16,372
Lots and lots of money.

560
00:37:22,895 --> 00:37:25,450
Wiggy's brother's got a place in Brentford.

561
00:37:25,484 --> 00:37:28,004
I'm not going to Brentford.

562
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:30,489
Stephen's right, and Mr. Eddowes.

563
00:37:30,524 --> 00:37:32,526
You have to hand yourself in.

564
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,734
Fuck that.

565
00:37:36,012 --> 00:37:38,497
"Mr. Eddowes."

566
00:37:38,532 --> 00:37:42,294
- That who you're seeing?
- Don't start that again, checking up on me.

567
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:44,814
I'm doing this
so we don't have
to cough up for a solicitor.

568
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:49,025
It's normal to want
to know where you are,
if we're together.

569
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:49,991
"If."

570
00:37:51,441 --> 00:37:52,546
Is that a question?

571
00:37:55,169 --> 00:37:57,620
Oh, no, no. Hold on!

572
00:37:59,587 --> 00:38:00,795
It's hard.

573
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:02,832
The walls are closing in, you know?

574
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:05,421
Being stuck in here all day and all night.

575
00:38:05,455 --> 00:38:07,388
Well, you brought that on yourself.

576
00:38:07,423 --> 00:38:08,838
I was protecting you!

577
00:38:10,874 --> 00:38:12,428
You're my girl, Christine.

578
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,879
Doesn't mean you bloody own me!

579
00:38:21,954 --> 00:38:25,993
You look particularly lovely
tonight, is this new?

580
00:38:26,027 --> 00:38:29,824
Erm, yes, a few weeks actually.

581
00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:33,172
It is ridiculous how this is being reported,

582
00:38:33,207 --> 00:38:36,831
like some glorious American victory!

583
00:38:36,866 --> 00:38:40,007
- Can I get you another drink?
- Thank you, my dear.

584
00:38:42,216 --> 00:38:44,667
Can you believe this?
I rather think you have to...

585
00:38:44,701 --> 00:38:47,532
Close your eyes and think
of the free legal advice.

586
00:38:47,566 --> 00:38:49,016
Hm?

587
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:50,949
Believe me.

588
00:38:50,983 --> 00:38:53,779
Khrushchev has made
some counter-demands
to the Americans.

589
00:38:53,814 --> 00:38:57,196
- Wait and see.
- God, change the bloody record!

590
00:38:57,231 --> 00:39:00,096
America was always going
to come out on top, wasn't it?

591
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:02,132
More naval and air power,

592
00:39:02,167 --> 00:39:04,376
loads more intercontinental missiles

593
00:39:04,411 --> 00:39:08,035
Mandy is the expert. We should all listen to her!

594
00:39:08,069 --> 00:39:09,933
I can read the paper.

595
00:39:09,968 --> 00:39:12,488
Russia's got the ground troops
but that doesn't matter anymore.

596
00:39:12,522 --> 00:39:14,731
"The theatre of war has shifted."

597
00:39:14,766 --> 00:39:18,079
Of course ground troops matter!

598
00:39:19,253 --> 00:39:22,670
Ask the Germans if ground troops matter.

599
00:39:22,705 --> 00:39:27,054
Mr. Profumo would be able to fill us in, perhaps.

600
00:39:27,088 --> 00:39:30,816
I'm not sure if I want
to know how close we came
to being blown to kingdom come,

601
00:39:30,851 --> 00:39:32,887
thank you very much.

602
00:39:32,922 --> 00:39:35,994
- You know Profumo?
- Not as well as Christine, by the look of it.

603
00:39:38,859 --> 00:39:42,656
Beautiful place, Cliveden. Very English. Typical.

604
00:39:43,864 --> 00:39:45,590
And at the Spring Cottage,

605
00:39:45,624 --> 00:39:48,178
Stephen is the host with the most.

606
00:39:48,213 --> 00:39:49,732
Cheers to that!

607
00:39:49,766 --> 00:39:51,872
- Nah zda-rovh-yeh.

608
00:39:51,906 --> 00:39:54,115
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

609
00:40:03,297 --> 00:40:04,678
Your turn.

610
00:40:08,958 --> 00:40:10,442
Stop it!

611
00:40:10,477 --> 00:40:12,582
Right, I think it's time for a race!

612
00:40:12,617 --> 00:40:14,826
- Girls against boys!
- No. Piggy back race.

613
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,656
- Girls on boys' shoulders.
- Oh, my goodness.

614
00:40:17,691 --> 00:40:20,590
No, no. Let's do Russia against England!

615
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:23,628
Yes, if you insist!
Over here, young lady.
Your country needs you.

616
00:40:23,662 --> 00:40:25,699
Oh!

617
00:40:25,733 --> 00:40:27,666
No, don't tickle me!

618
00:40:30,497 --> 00:40:33,223
Honestly, they're like children
sometimes, aren't they?

619
00:40:33,258 --> 00:40:35,640
On your starting marks, please.

620
00:40:35,674 --> 00:40:36,882
Wait, wait.

621
00:40:36,917 --> 00:40:39,057
Not exactly like children.

622
00:40:39,091 --> 00:40:43,061
And ready steady go!

623
00:40:43,095 --> 00:40:44,614
Oh!

624
00:40:44,649 --> 00:40:46,513
Yes!

625
00:40:46,547 --> 00:40:47,824
Oh, no!

626
00:40:48,963 --> 00:40:51,897
Yeah! England won!

627
00:40:51,932 --> 00:40:54,693
- Fantastic.

628
00:41:00,734 --> 00:41:03,702
Are you sure we haven't met before?

629
00:41:03,737 --> 00:41:05,808
You look so awfully familiar.

630
00:41:22,307 --> 00:41:24,620
I've never been anywhere like this before.

631
00:41:24,654 --> 00:41:25,966
It's charming, isn't it?

632
00:41:29,245 --> 00:41:31,005
Bloody hell.

633
00:41:32,351 --> 00:41:34,492
- There's a lot to dust!

634
00:41:36,563 --> 00:41:38,288
It's like being in a fairy tale.

635
00:41:39,635 --> 00:41:40,739
Hmm.

636
00:41:44,156 --> 00:41:46,227
Murray's!

637
00:41:46,262 --> 00:41:48,057
Murray's club, with the feathers.

638
00:41:48,091 --> 00:41:51,681
Oh, yeah, that's me!

639
00:41:51,716 --> 00:41:53,027
Did we have a drink?

640
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:59,206
Sorry, I have drinks with lots of gentlemen.

641
00:42:22,919 --> 00:42:25,577
- Ha, here you are!
- Ah.

642
00:42:25,612 --> 00:42:27,752
Another race.

643
00:42:27,786 --> 00:42:29,823
Best out of three. I insist!

644
00:42:29,857 --> 00:42:32,032
- Come on!
- All right.

645
00:42:32,066 --> 00:42:34,862
National honor must be satisfied.

646
00:42:35,967 --> 00:42:38,866
- Ah! Ah!
- No! No!

647
00:42:38,901 --> 00:42:41,662
Let's go!

648
00:42:41,697 --> 00:42:43,043
Stop it!

649
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:56,643
Mr. Eddowes says you corrupted me.

650
00:42:57,644 --> 00:43:01,061
I hope you've told him
I was very late
to that party, darling.

651
00:43:01,095 --> 00:43:02,614
Piss off.

652
00:43:06,653 --> 00:43:08,240
Have you ever been in love?

653
00:43:11,002 --> 00:43:13,142
Twenty times a day, little baby, you know me.

654
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,249
Why have we never done it, do you think?

655
00:43:18,423 --> 00:43:19,735
You shagged Mandy.

656
00:43:21,253 --> 00:43:23,462
Are you frightened of me, Stephen?

657
00:43:23,497 --> 00:43:26,327
What are you scared of?

658
00:43:26,362 --> 00:43:28,744
- Yes, thank you.

659
00:43:34,853 --> 00:43:37,166
I swear, when I'm sat in Mr. Eddowes car,

660
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,826
it's like I'm twelve again, thirteen,

661
00:43:43,759 --> 00:43:47,210
all those dads
used to touch me up
when I babysat their kids.

662
00:43:48,246 --> 00:43:50,973
Some wrinkly old cock.

663
00:43:51,939 --> 00:43:53,734
You don't have to look!

664
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,154
Well, you don't! Why would you?

665
00:44:00,189 --> 00:44:02,329
What? Ever?

666
00:44:02,363 --> 00:44:05,850
There you have it,
that is why Mandy has
a mink coat and a Jaguar.

667
00:44:05,884 --> 00:44:09,923
And will have a diamond ring
and a flat in Mayfair
by the time she's twenty one.

668
00:44:09,957 --> 00:44:13,167
Last of the great romantics, our Mand.

669
00:44:14,479 --> 00:44:16,170
Peter's dead.

670
00:44:18,897 --> 00:44:20,692
He's had a heart attack.

671
00:44:22,176 --> 00:44:23,937
It's not a joke!

672
00:44:25,904 --> 00:44:27,941
They found him in his car.

673
00:44:29,252 --> 00:44:30,909
He's dropped dead!

674
00:44:30,944 --> 00:44:34,361
I was foul to him the last time I saw him!

675
00:44:34,395 --> 00:44:37,295
I never knew,
and now I'll never
be able to say sorry.

676
00:44:37,329 --> 00:44:40,712
- Shhh.
- I told him he had bad breath.

677
00:44:40,747 --> 00:44:43,542
I didn't mean it!

678
00:44:43,577 --> 00:44:46,131
- I didn't!
- Little baby.

679
00:44:58,592 --> 00:45:03,424
Hey, err--I'm sorry about before, doll.

680
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:06,911
Johnny?

681
00:45:23,893 --> 00:45:27,207
Hey, Christine, how's it hanging beautiful?

682
00:45:27,241 --> 00:45:30,003
- We have mellor opium.
- Darrell, have you seen Johnny?

683
00:45:30,037 --> 00:45:32,177
He may be around here somewhere.

684
00:45:39,806 --> 00:45:42,498
What the hell are you doing
with my boyfriend, you bitch?

685
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:43,948
He's not your boyfriend.

686
00:45:43,982 --> 00:45:45,777
He bloody is!

687
00:45:45,812 --> 00:45:47,572
Look at you, he must be desperate.

688
00:45:48,918 --> 00:45:51,472
Hey! No, come on. Come on. Cool it, Christine!

689
00:45:51,507 --> 00:45:53,854
You can't keep it
in your trousers
for one bloody night?

690
00:45:53,889 --> 00:45:55,925
Why should I?
You off putting it
around the West End.

691
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,341
For you! You're the one who cut Lucky Gordon.

692
00:45:58,376 --> 00:46:00,309
Who wanted the gun, Christine?

693
00:46:00,343 --> 00:46:02,587
- I got coppers asking everywhere looking for me.
- Fuck off!

694
00:46:02,621 --> 00:46:04,485
I've got the law all over me because of you!

695
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,799
Screw the little
scrubber's brains out,
I don't give a toss.

696
00:46:07,834 --> 00:46:09,594
And if you think I'm gonna
stand up for you in court

697
00:46:09,628 --> 00:46:11,630
or get a solicitor for you John Edgecombe,

698
00:46:11,665 --> 00:46:13,460
you've got another fucking thing coming!

699
00:46:13,494 --> 00:46:14,633
Get out of my way!

700
00:46:14,668 --> 00:46:16,221
Oh!

701
00:46:28,199 --> 00:46:29,269
Darling.

702
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:33,238
Sexy.

703
00:46:35,862 --> 00:46:38,071
These floors are freezing.

704
00:46:38,105 --> 00:46:41,488
There's a Rembrandt
in the study, but they're
too mean to heat the house.

705
00:46:41,522 --> 00:46:45,009
When you said party,
I thought you meant party party.

706
00:46:45,043 --> 00:46:46,527
Are you not in the mood?

707
00:46:46,562 --> 00:46:48,115
Thank you.

708
00:46:48,598 --> 00:46:52,223
As my mother used to say,
"If you're bored,
you're boring."

709
00:46:53,362 --> 00:46:55,122
God, if people knew...

710
00:46:56,089 --> 00:47:01,025
When I left home,
I had this idea in my head
about London's society,

711
00:47:01,059 --> 00:47:02,474
whatever it's called.

712
00:47:03,406 --> 00:47:05,546
Like everyone posh was better.

713
00:47:05,581 --> 00:47:08,135
Sex is the great equalizer, little baby.

714
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:11,104
You always say that,
but no-one's doing this
in Wraysbury.

715
00:47:11,138 --> 00:47:13,175
Two people, lights out, ten minutes.

716
00:47:17,662 --> 00:47:20,078
Agh! I should write a bloody book.

717
00:47:20,113 --> 00:47:23,910
Christine, dear, who's the Prime Minister?

718
00:47:25,187 --> 00:47:26,326
Why, is he here?

719
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,431
No. I mean, what is his name?

720
00:47:28,466 --> 00:47:30,675
If you're going to be a writer.

721
00:47:30,709 --> 00:47:32,919
Our good old PM.

722
00:47:34,127 --> 00:47:36,370
Oh, I'm not stupid, Stephen!

723
00:47:36,405 --> 00:47:38,925
I know you're not,
but you are
deliciously ignorant.

724
00:47:38,959 --> 00:47:40,892
Why are you being so horrible?

725
00:47:42,549 --> 00:47:43,688
Hey...

726
00:47:44,965 --> 00:47:48,106
Little baby. Huh?

727
00:47:50,453 --> 00:47:53,905
Can I stay with you for a bit?

728
00:47:55,113 --> 00:47:56,666
I'd be delighted.

729
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:08,023
Time for cocoa and pajamas, I think.

730
00:48:28,526 --> 00:48:31,046
You couldn't lend me a fiver, could you?

731
00:48:33,117 --> 00:48:36,016
I've got my mum breathing
down my neck about her rates.

732
00:48:50,203 --> 00:48:52,101
Need to cash a cheque.

733
00:48:56,036 --> 00:49:00,627
Must dash, Maharajah with a frozen shoulder.

734
00:49:01,766 --> 00:49:04,389
Help yourself to whatever there is, little baby.

735
00:49:05,252 --> 00:49:06,529
Not much, I'm afraid.

736
00:49:09,049 --> 00:49:10,948
I was really in love with Johnny.

737
00:49:14,123 --> 00:49:16,436
Oh, little baby.

738
00:49:19,301 --> 00:49:20,750
You always are.

739
00:49:22,649 --> 00:49:25,031
Until the next one, huh?

740
00:49:30,829 --> 00:49:33,073
No one understands you like I do,

741
00:49:34,661 --> 00:49:36,007
that's the thing.

742
00:49:37,526 --> 00:49:38,803
We're twins.

743
00:49:42,738 --> 00:49:48,123
- No, were bloody not, Stephen.

744
00:50:34,203 --> 00:50:35,860
May I telephone you?

745
00:50:38,276 --> 00:50:41,797
I'm in the book. Stephen's number.

746
00:51:03,474 --> 00:51:06,649
- The new suit?
- Yes, what do you think?

747
00:51:09,411 --> 00:51:11,758
- Very dashing.
- Yeah.

748
00:51:11,792 --> 00:51:15,244
Though do ask your tailor
if it's necessary to cut
your trousers so tight

749
00:51:15,279 --> 00:51:17,246
the world can see your penis?

750
00:51:17,281 --> 00:51:18,799
All right.

751
00:51:18,834 --> 00:51:20,939
"It pays to advertise," isn't that what they say?

752
00:51:20,974 --> 00:51:22,769
Depends on what you're selling.

753
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:30,846
Don't you think
a prospective leader
had better shut up shop?

754
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,642
Particularly if he's playing happy families.

755
00:51:34,574 --> 00:51:36,783
Well, you never know.

756
00:51:36,817 --> 00:51:39,717
After Macmillan the country
might be rather grateful

757
00:51:39,751 --> 00:51:42,271
for a Prime Minister with a working todger.

758
00:51:43,962 --> 00:51:46,896
If you have a fault, darling,
it is over-confidence.

759
00:51:47,759 --> 00:51:49,485
And don't say "todger", Jack.

760
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,419
Not if you ever want to fuck me again.

761
00:51:52,454 --> 00:51:54,214
Oh, but I do...

762
00:52:19,308 --> 00:52:20,516
Laddie died.

763
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:27,489
It's from my sister.

764
00:52:29,215 --> 00:52:30,526
My pony...

765
00:52:33,702 --> 00:52:36,636
he was hit by a car the same day Peter passed.

766
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:38,603
Isn't that strange?

767
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,609
I saved every penny I had to pay for Laddie.

768
00:52:48,303 --> 00:52:50,891
When he was twelve he was my whole world!

769
00:52:53,377 --> 00:52:55,448
- You'll get over it.

770
00:52:55,482 --> 00:52:57,760
- I know I will. But I feel really shitty now!

771
00:52:59,452 --> 00:53:01,937
- Christine!
- Shit! It's Johnny.

772
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:04,698
- I know you're in there.

773
00:53:04,733 --> 00:53:07,632
Get your arse down here!

774
00:53:07,667 --> 00:53:09,634
I got the law all over me 'cos of Lucky.

775
00:53:09,669 --> 00:53:12,292
- Tell him I'm not here!
- Well, where are you?

776
00:53:12,327 --> 00:53:14,950
- Make it up. Say I'm at the hairdressers.
- Christine!

777
00:53:14,984 --> 00:53:16,779
I'll not be a sacrifice!

778
00:53:16,814 --> 00:53:19,955
What? Any black stud do for you?

779
00:53:19,989 --> 00:53:22,302
You not be messing with me no more!

780
00:53:22,337 --> 00:53:24,373
She's not here, she's gone to the hairdresser!

781
00:53:24,408 --> 00:53:26,651
Bullshit! Christine!

782
00:53:26,686 --> 00:53:29,758
I've got a taxi waiting for me,
it's costing me money!

783
00:53:29,792 --> 00:53:31,691
Christine!

784
00:53:32,623 --> 00:53:34,487
- Come on!
- There it is!

785
00:53:34,521 --> 00:53:37,041
- Now you can piss off!
- What you playing at?

786
00:53:37,075 --> 00:53:39,699
- I'm coming for you!
- Big man!

787
00:53:39,733 --> 00:53:41,632
You're winding him up!

788
00:53:41,666 --> 00:53:43,634
Go back to your little
spacky-faced bitch
at the shebeen!

789
00:53:43,668 --> 00:53:45,532
She doesn't even know
what it feels like
to have a real man!

790
00:54:04,793 --> 00:54:07,623
Stephen, Johnny
is trying to kill us.
You need to come quick!

791
00:54:11,109 --> 00:54:12,904
Drive now, drive!

792
00:54:13,629 --> 00:54:14,837
Yes, now!

793
00:54:28,989 --> 00:54:30,853
And can I quote you on that?

794
00:54:30,888 --> 00:54:33,649
- Mandy...
- Rice-Davis, with a hyphen.

795
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:37,757
Christine's the model and I'm an actress...

796
00:54:38,447 --> 00:54:39,931
- Christine?
- Keeler.

797
00:54:39,966 --> 00:54:41,899
K-E-E-L-E-R.

798
00:54:44,453 --> 00:54:47,939
You got the hyphen for me? Uh?

799
00:54:54,567 --> 00:54:58,433
John Edgecombe,
I'm arresting you on suspicion
of attempted murder--

800
00:54:58,467 --> 00:55:01,401
- I didn't do anything!
- Shut it! I don't want to hear
any more from you!

801
00:55:01,436 --> 00:55:04,646
Get in the car, fucking coon!

802
00:55:11,549 --> 00:55:13,862
- Thanks for your time, Mr. Ward.
- Thank you so much Sergeant.

803
00:55:17,555 --> 00:55:20,489
Well, little baby, I did warn you.

804
00:55:20,524 --> 00:55:23,768
The poo-poo has well and truly hit the propeller.

805
00:55:26,564 --> 00:55:27,669
Come on.

806
00:55:30,672 --> 00:55:32,881
I am not a bad person.

807
00:55:33,744 --> 00:55:37,782
I am young, and I like to have fun.

808
00:55:38,749 --> 00:55:42,131
And like any girl my age I have made mistakes.

809
00:55:50,899 --> 00:55:54,903
Yes, Mr. Profumo was keeping a secret.

810
00:55:56,042 --> 00:55:57,388
We both were.

811
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:59,701
But we weren't the only ones.

812
00:56:00,943 --> 00:56:03,221
And believe me, the secrets that surrounded us

813
00:56:03,256 --> 00:56:05,810
let to a far more than a few harmless lies.

814
00:56:08,606 --> 00:56:10,436
- It's true.

815
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:12,679
Terrible crimes have being committed.

816
00:56:13,784 --> 00:56:15,233
But not by me.

817
00:56:16,787 --> 00:56:17,891
Yes, sir.

818
00:56:19,755 --> 00:56:23,656
Yes, looks like the girls
could be a problem
after all, sir.

819
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:31,905
Christine!

820
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:35,219
Christine Keeler?

821
00:56:36,669 --> 00:56:39,119
- Who says so?
- That's not a face anyone's
gonna forget in a hurry!

822
00:56:40,051 --> 00:56:43,986
We would love to hear
your story, Christine,
when you're ready.

823
00:56:45,194 --> 00:56:47,783
The story behind the story.

824
00:56:48,301 --> 00:56:53,168
We'll pay you good money for it,
photos as well. Double bubble.

825
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:00,555
Think about it!

826
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:04,075
All right. I will.

827
00:57:06,802 --> 00:57:09,840
I didn't know it,
but I still had a hell
of a lot to learn.

828
00:57:11,186 --> 00:57:14,189
I was naive, I can see that now.

829
00:57:15,224 --> 00:57:19,056
But so was he. And he was a man of the world.

830
00:57:25,614 --> 00:57:26,788
Hello.

831
00:57:27,305 --> 00:57:29,169
So you found me in the book then?

832
00:57:30,032 --> 00:57:31,689
Don't you look ravishing?

833
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:33,829
Thank you.

834
00:57:38,972 --> 00:57:42,873
My carriage awaits if you fancy a spin.

835
00:57:45,013 --> 00:57:46,877
Why don't you come in first? John.

836
00:57:50,156 --> 00:57:53,470
Call me Jack. All my friends do.

837
00:57:54,988 --> 00:57:56,024
Jack.

838
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:01,892
I wasn't expecting happily
ever after. Just a bit of fun.

839
00:58:02,996 --> 00:58:07,760
But what started as harmless fun has sown the seeds of scandal.

840
00:58:07,794 --> 00:58:11,764
The most serious scandal
this country has ever faced.
