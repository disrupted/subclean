Or you said yes
and she already regrets it.

She's having a hard time of it.

kind out here, Captain.

[click]

359
00:22:45,581 --> 00:22:47,148
Put your finger
beside the trigger.

360
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:49,106
Not on it.
Till I tell you.

361
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,720
- Is it going to kick?

362
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:58,638
- It's gonna kick.
And it's gonna hurt.

363
00:22:58,725 --> 00:23:00,204
But you won't remember
the kick in a week.

364
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:01,249
All you'll remember is the kill.

365
00:23:01,336 --> 00:23:03,294
Look through there.

366
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,819
Put the cross hairs right
behind his shoulder.

367
00:23:05,906 --> 00:23:06,820
- Yes, sir.

368
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:07,821
- Is it there?

369
00:23:07,908 --> 00:23:09,388
- Yes, sir.

370
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:10,911
- Put your finger
on the trigger.

371
00:23:10,998 --> 00:23:12,608
Pull slowly.

372
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,225
You got him.

373
00:23:21,312 --> 00:23:23,532
- I got him?

374
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:25,142
- You got him, son.

375
00:23:25,229 --> 00:23:26,535
[laughs]

376
00:23:32,193 --> 00:23:33,629
Let's go get him.

377
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:42,116
[grunts]

378
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:50,429
Watch your step, son.

379
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:00,308
- He's huge.

380
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:02,049
- Yes, sir, he is.

381
00:24:02,136 --> 00:24:03,442
He'll feed us for a week.

382
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:05,487
[cutting]

383
00:24:05,574 --> 00:24:06,662
Now, come here.

384
00:24:11,754 --> 00:24:13,452
It's your first kill,
so I gotta blood you.

385
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,631
There we go.

386
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:25,028
You took a life to give us life.

387
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,683
So now we say thank you.

388
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,903
- To who?

389
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,470
- To the deer.

390
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:35,343
- But the deer's dead.
He can't hear us.

391
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,301
- Well, we say thank you anyway.

392
00:24:37,388 --> 00:24:39,390
- How do we say thank you?

393
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,131
- We just say it.

394
00:24:43,177 --> 00:24:44,526
- Thank you.

395
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:52,795
- When you kill a thing, son,

396
00:24:52,882 --> 00:24:55,015
it makes you
a little less man,

397
00:24:55,102 --> 00:24:57,844
a little more animal.

398
00:24:57,931 --> 00:25:00,803
Now we try to find the balance
between them.

399
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:03,240
That's all life is.

400
00:25:03,327 --> 00:25:04,720
You understand?

401
00:25:08,245 --> 00:25:10,073
I didn't either
first time I heard it.

402
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,556
Hey, we got work to do.

403
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:31,268
[horse snorts]

404
00:25:43,193 --> 00:25:45,108
- Took the liberty
of stoking it.

405
00:25:45,195 --> 00:25:46,893
Got your water boiled.

406
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,590
- Well, I appreciate you
saving me the time.

407
00:25:48,677 --> 00:25:50,505
[sizzle]

408
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,552
You hungry?
- Never turned down fresh meat.

409
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:55,075
- John, get washed up.

410
00:25:58,034 --> 00:26:01,211
If I take them east,

411
00:26:01,298 --> 00:26:03,910
it adds three weeks to the trip
the way they're moving.

412
00:26:03,997 --> 00:26:06,608
Puts us at South Pass
in October.

413
00:26:06,695 --> 00:26:08,305
November even...

414
00:26:08,392 --> 00:26:09,306
- West is the way.

415
00:26:09,393 --> 00:26:10,917
- Gotta cross the Brazos.

416
00:26:11,004 --> 00:26:12,788
- I'll take my chances
with the Brazos.

417
00:26:15,922 --> 00:26:18,751
- You said you'd help...
and you're not helping.

418
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:24,234
- My wife and my daughter
are out there right now

419
00:26:24,321 --> 00:26:25,801
babysitting their goddam cattle.

420
00:26:25,888 --> 00:26:27,586
- The only hope
these people have

421
00:26:27,673 --> 00:26:29,631
is following without question.

422
00:26:29,718 --> 00:26:32,634
Doing exactly as I say.

423
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:34,462
Without question.

424
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:36,420
- I don't disagree.

425
00:26:36,507 --> 00:26:37,987
- You questioned.

426
00:26:38,074 --> 00:26:40,250
You questioned my authority
and I cannot have it.

427
00:26:40,337 --> 00:26:42,426
- I questioned going east
and now we're going west

428
00:26:42,513 --> 00:26:43,950
and I was right to question.

429
00:26:44,037 --> 00:26:45,516
Let's get one thing straight,

430
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,780
I don't work for you and
I ain't one of your patrons.

431
00:26:47,867 --> 00:26:49,869
The only family out I give
a shit about is mine.

432
00:26:49,956 --> 00:26:50,870
- You've made that clear.

433
00:26:50,957 --> 00:26:52,349
- I hope so.

434
00:26:57,441 --> 00:26:58,486
[horse snorts]

435
00:27:01,532 --> 00:27:04,013
- I'm going to hold up
here for three days.

436
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,319
Give you a head start.

437
00:27:05,406 --> 00:27:07,103
[chuckles]

438
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,105
- So I can flush out
every bandit

439
00:27:09,192 --> 00:27:10,324
between here and West Texas?

440
00:27:12,326 --> 00:27:15,416
You go first, and I'll follow
you with the herd.

441
00:27:15,503 --> 00:27:16,678
- Fair enough.

442
00:27:24,817 --> 00:27:25,774
- Come here, John.

443
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,560
Take that to the tent.

444
00:27:37,743 --> 00:27:38,744
Think I'll jerk the rest.

445
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:53,497
[music]

446
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:03,116
- <i>I always thought of mothers</i> <i>
like nervous chickens,</i>

447
00:28:03,203 --> 00:28:06,293
<i>too worried about their clutch
to ever hunt for a worm.</i>

448
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,818
<i>In my mind,</i> <i>
my mother was a banker,</i>

449
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:12,473
<i>hoarding my freedom</i> <i>
like money.</i>

450
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,605
<i>I never once thought</i> <i>
of her as a woman</i>

451
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,652
<i>with desires and</i> <i>
dreams and passion,</i>

452
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:20,829
<i>though passion</i> <i>
is the thing that made me.</i>

453
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:23,179
<i>I lie awake at night</i>

454
00:28:23,266 --> 00:28:26,792
<i>and my dreams for this</i> <i>
life burn inside me</i>

455
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:29,969
<i>as if I'd walked to the</i> <i>
campfire and tried to eat it.</i>

456
00:28:32,058 --> 00:28:35,670
<i>I watched my mother</i> <i>
and I felt foolish for thinking</i>

457
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:38,673
<i>the notion of eating</i> <i>

458
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,720
<i>It was hers first.</i>

459
00:28:41,807 --> 00:28:42,938
<i>Then she gave it to me.</i>

460
00:28:49,858 --> 00:28:52,208
<i>I watched her ride</i> <i>
and I didn't see my mother.</i>

461
00:28:53,514 --> 00:28:54,602
<i>I saw a woman.</i>

462
00:28:58,867 --> 00:29:00,695
<i>And the woman was magnificent.</i>

[speaking German]

465
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:26,373
- He beat me.
Destroy my wagon.

466
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,854
Strand me here, for what?

467
00:29:30,551 --> 00:29:33,032
For some gypsy whore!

468
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:34,729
- You stole from her.

469
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:37,123
- I stole back
what her husband took.

470
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:39,473
- And now he's in the ground.

471
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,562
- Where he belongs.

472
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,656
- What do you want me to do?

473
00:29:48,743 --> 00:29:50,745
- We don't need them.

474
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:53,139
We go north to mountain,
west to ocean.

475
00:29:53,226 --> 00:29:56,142
We don't need guide for that.

476
00:29:56,229 --> 00:30:00,842
- We need him.
We need him for protection.

477
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:03,453
- Who he protect?
Huh?

478
00:30:06,152 --> 00:30:10,286
Not Stefan, not David,
not Luca.

479
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:13,028
Alexandria, Daria?

480
00:30:13,115 --> 00:30:14,595
No...

481
00:30:14,682 --> 00:30:16,553
Just the whore.

482
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,255
- She's a mother.
- [spits]

483
00:30:22,342 --> 00:30:24,431
- We can find the way
without them.

484
00:30:24,518 --> 00:30:28,652
Only thing they have of use
is guns and horses.

485
00:30:28,739 --> 00:30:30,002
- Then come take 'em.

486
00:30:37,444 --> 00:30:38,575
- Take three steps to the right.

487
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:42,536
- Why?

488
00:30:42,623 --> 00:30:43,972
- So I don't kill the woman
standing behind you.

489
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:46,801
[speaking German]

490
00:30:55,244 --> 00:30:56,985
Hope you had a chance
to practice with that.

491
00:31:00,684 --> 00:31:01,729
You ready?

492
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:05,124
You want my horse, take it.

493
00:31:05,211 --> 00:31:07,778
Let's go.
Come on!

494
00:31:13,088 --> 00:31:14,785
I can't make it much easier
than that.

00:31:19,616 --> 00:31:20,617
Bang.

496
00:31:30,976 --> 00:31:33,935
During the war...

497
00:31:34,022 --> 00:31:37,417
we fought a battle at this place
called the wilderness,

498
00:31:37,504 --> 00:31:42,944
'cause there was nothing
around but wilderness.

499
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:47,688
I fired my rifle so many
times the barrel melted,

500
00:31:47,775 --> 00:31:51,344
just drooped like rotten fruit.

501
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:54,086
So, I killed with my pistol.

502
00:31:54,173 --> 00:31:56,523
And when I ran out of bullets
I killed with my sword.

503
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:01,093
And when my sword broke I killed
with my boots and bare hands.

504
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,834
[sobbing]

505
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,011
When the battle was over

506
00:32:06,098 --> 00:32:11,451
and I looked behind me,
the wilderness was gone.

507
00:32:11,538 --> 00:32:14,236
Not a tree left standing.

508
00:32:14,323 --> 00:32:17,631
Chopped down chest-high
by bullets.

509
00:32:19,111 --> 00:32:22,853
We killed five
thousand men that day.

510
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:26,770
When I say killing you means
nothing to me, I mean it.

511
00:32:26,857 --> 00:32:29,251
Killing you means nothing.

512
00:32:45,485 --> 00:32:48,096
What did I say I'd do
the next time I saw you?

513
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:53,145
What did I say?

514
00:32:55,712 --> 00:32:58,672
I said I'd kill you,
didn't I?

515
00:32:58,759 --> 00:32:59,542
It's what I said...

516
00:33:03,633 --> 00:33:05,853
This is your only chance
to make a liar out of me.

517
00:33:17,821 --> 00:33:19,258
I said it to you, too.

518
00:33:20,563 --> 00:33:21,608
[whispering in German]

519
00:33:25,351 --> 00:33:28,093
You can police yourselves
or I can do it for you.

520
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,357
Now you've seen how I do it.

521
00:33:33,794 --> 00:33:35,056
Choice is yours...

522
00:33:36,318 --> 00:33:39,104
We leave tomorrow.
We head west.

523
00:33:39,191 --> 00:33:41,149
Water will be scarce.

524
00:33:41,236 --> 00:33:44,065
Take what you can
carry from here.

525
00:33:44,152 --> 00:33:45,284
And boil it first.

526
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:58,210
- I don't think you're gonna
win a medal for wagon boss.

527
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,971
- Let's keep her wagon up front.

528
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,104
We can take turns driving it.

529
00:34:23,191 --> 00:34:24,932
- You think they'll
come after her?

530
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:30,416
- I think they're going to go
to Fort Worth and get drunk

531
00:34:30,503 --> 00:34:34,159
and talk about all these
wagons heading north,

532
00:34:34,246 --> 00:34:36,726
find some men a whole lot
tougher than they are,

533
00:34:36,813 --> 00:34:38,163
and then come back
for all of us.

534
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,599
- Mm.
