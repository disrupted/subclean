00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,020
<i>Fuck you.</i>

179
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:58,486
<i>I think it's strange you never knew </i>

180
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,459
<i>Hey.</i>

181
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,919
<i>Hey.</i>

182
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,797
<i>Is it cool if I...?</i>

183
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,216
<i>Oh. Yeah. Yeah.</i>

184
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:23,803
<i>So, how'd you convince Misty to go?</i>

185
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,222
<i>Ha. Well...</i>

186
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:29,141
<i>Believe it or not, I didn't have to.</i>

187
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:32,478
<i>I did think about it, but, uh...</i>

188
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,813
<i>she beat me to the punch.</i>

189
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,273
<i>Ouch. Dumped by Misty Quigley?</i>

190
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,234
<i>That is-- that's rough, man.</i>

191
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:41,111
<i>You guys do know that we were never...</i>

192
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,739
<i>Well, I'm pretty sure she's not your type.</i>

193
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,533
<i>Yeah, what's that?</i>

194
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,868
<i>You like guys, right?</i>

195
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,038
<i>What?</i>

196
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,165
<i>- What the hell, Nat?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

197
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,333
<i>- Why would you--</i>
<i>- I'm sorry, I...</i>

198
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,793
<i>I didn't mean to...</i>

199
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,127
<i>I don't know.</i>

200
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,964
<i>It's just, you never look at our boobs.</i>

201
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,011
<i>No, I think it's cool.</i>

202
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,350
<i>You have a... boyfriend?</i>

203
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,814
<i>Yeah, I did.</i>

204
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,984
<i>Paul.</i>

205
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,861
<i>He's a... writer.</i>

206
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,864
<i>He actually wanted me</i>
<i>to move into the city with him.</i>

207
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:30,119
<i>You know, really be with him, but...</i>

208
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:35,791
<i>If you lost him, you're afraid</i>
<i>you'd have nothing left.</i>

209
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,718
<i>You don't think that...</i>

210
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,305
<i>that Travis is gay, do you?</i>

211
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,186
<i>We tried to...</i>

212
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,439
<i>you know, and he couldn't.</i>

213
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,858
<i>- He kind of, like, lost...</i>
<i>- Oh.</i>

214
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,402
<i>Right. Yeah.</i>

215
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,323
<i>Well, just so you know, that's not, uh...</i>

216
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,992
<i>It's not exactly unheard-of.</i>

217
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,827
<i>- </i>
<i>- Uh...</i>

218
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,330
<i>guessing that he just got nervous,</i>

219
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,582
<i>- you know, up in his head.</i>
<i>- Mm.</i>

220
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,919
<i>Trust me, Nat, I've seen</i>
<i>the way that kid looks at you.</i>

221
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,755
<i>He's... he's in pretty deep.</i>

222
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,176
<i>I just mean...</i>

223
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,595
<i>don't make too big a deal out of it.</i>

224
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,181
<i>I'm sure he'll be happy to get another chance,</i>

225
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:35,601
<i>if you want to give him one.</i>

226
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,020
<i>Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

227
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,605
<i>Well, thanks, Coach.</i>

228
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,777
<i>Listen, Nat.</i>

229
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,862
<i>If, uh...</i>

230
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,907
<i>i-if any of this ever got out...</i>

231
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,617
<i>No, I-I won't tell anyone.</i>

232
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,953
<i>I promise.</i>

233
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,919
<i>I got you.</i>

234
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,212
<i>- Just put...</i>

235
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,421
<i>put one foot in front of the other.</i>

236
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,094
<i>When we get back, we're</i>
<i>gonna need sterile water and...</i>

237
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,387
<i>and thread to stitch up her face.</i>

238
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:14,723
<i>No. Leave me.</i>

239
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,476
<i>Van, stop it.</i>

240
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,646
<i>It's... not... safe.</i>

241
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,106
<i>Don't say that.</i>

242
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,816
<i>- We're almost there.</i>

243
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,943
<i>Tai. Tai.</i>

244
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,488
<i>L... L...</i>

245
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,365
<i>Let them go.</i>

246
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,992
<i>No.</i>

247
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,412
<i>Let them go.</i>

248
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,792
<i>Go back to the cabin as fast as you can.</i>

249
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,669
<i>We'll be right behind you, okay?</i>

250
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,920
<i>Tai?</i>

251
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,923
<i>Go.</i>

252
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,508
<i>Go!</i>

253
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,680
<i>No. Ah!</i>

254
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,851
<i>Ah.</i>

255
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,158
<i>Caligula, you're being rude.</i>

256
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,705
<i>Your phone's ringing.</i>

257
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,081
<i>Uh, no, it's not.</i>

258
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,417
<i>- Took you long enough.</i>

259
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,170
<i>It's a live feed to my friend's hotel room.</i>

260
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,546
<i>So it is her phone that's ringing.</i>

261
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,548
<i>All right.</i>

262
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,091
<i>Naturally.</i>

263
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,974
<i>Wow. All right. </i>

264
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,728
<i>No. No, no, no, no, no.</i>

265
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,546
<i>Anything?</i>

266
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,715
<i>Nope.</i>

267
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,426
<i>Why aren't you out hunting?</i>

268
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,804
<i>Told Nat to go without me.</i>

269
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,098
<i>Something happen?</i>

270
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,558
<i>Isn't it some philosopher who said, uh,</i>

271
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,519
<i>"Anything that can happen will happen"?</i>

272
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,312
<i>Yeah, I don't know.</i>

273
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,023
<i>I'll, uh, go check my old philosophers handbook.</i>

274
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,278
<i>I just, um...</i>

275
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:37,574
<i>I think I really fucked things up.</i>

276
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,078
<i>Relationships are bullshit anyway.</i>

277
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,663
<i>Trust me.</i>

278
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,916
<i>Whatever you did, she'll get over it.</i>

279
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:50,087
<i>Let's face facts, Nat's standards are pretty low.</i>

280
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,714
<i>Cool. Thanks.</i>

281
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:53,966
<i>I didn't mean you.</i>

282
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,885
<i>And you're basically Brad Pitt</i>

283
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,138
<i>compared to the dirtbags she usually goes for.</i>

284
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,806
<i>Like, ugh, don't get me started</i>

285
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,350
<i>on that Bobby what's-his-face</i>
<i>she was hooking up with</i>

286
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,477
<i>before we left. Like, dude,</i>

287
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,105
<i>you graduated, why are you still</i>
<i>partying with high school girls?</i>

288
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,731
<i>I mean, she missed a week of practice</i>

289
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,108
<i>'cause she was too busy screwing him</i>

290
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,484
<i>in the back of his gross van.</i>

291
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,278
<i>I thought your dad would...</i>

292
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,446
<i>- Bobby who?</i>
<i>- Whatever.</i>

293
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,490
<i>It-it doesn't matter. I'm just, I'm saying...</i>

294
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,992
<i>Bobby who?</i>

295
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,662
<i>Jesus.</i>

296
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:24,913
<i>Farleigh.</i>

297
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,373
<i>Why, does it matter?</i>

298
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,776
<i>Oh. No.</i>

299
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,028
<i>- Um...</i>
<i>- No. Natalie.</i>

300
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,863
<i>Misty!</i>

301
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,699
<i>- What the fuck? Move.</i>

302
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,702
<i>- No, I will not let you.</i>
<i>- Get...</i>

303
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,662
<i>- Get off my coke, you...</i>

304
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,873
<i>Oh, it burns.</i>

305
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,333
<i>Is that normal? </i>

306
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,210
<i>What are you doing?</i>

307
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,170
<i>I'm trying to protect you.</i>

308
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,547
<i>Oh, my God. You're possessed!</i>

309
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,466
<i>- What the fuck?</i>
<i>- Don't breathe that.</i>

310
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,800
<i>Don't breathe that.</i>

311
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,561
<i>Hey. Can we talk?</i>

312
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,400
<i>Come on. You have to talk to me.</i>

313
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,236
<i>- You can't just keep...</i>
<i>- Bobby Farleigh?</i>

314
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,288
<i>Who told you?</i>

315
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,706
<i>- I can't believe you.</i>
<i>- Travis...</i>

316
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,625
<i>No, you lied to me. You said that you...</i>

317
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,585
<i>That I've only been with two guys. Yeah.</i>

318
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,921
<i>Because I knew that if I told you about it,</i>

319
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,464
<i>then you'd fucking hate me.</i>

320
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,800
<i>That was before I even knew you.</i>

321
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:03,637
<i>I had no idea about the whole stupid Flex thing.</i>

322
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:10,936
<i>I made a mistake, okay?</i>

323
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,815
<i>Yeah.</i>

324
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:19,069
<i>Well, apparently so did I.</i>

325
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,946
<i>What the fuck does that mean?</i>

326
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,281
<i>Hey.</i>

327
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,533
<i>What do you think it means, Nat?</i>

328
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:25,951
<i>Huh?</i>

329
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,417
<i>Are you seriously gonna ruin this</i>

330
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,461
<i>over something so fucking stupid?</i>

331
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,847
<i>Then I guess it's a good thing</i>
<i>you couldn't get it up.</i>

332
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:51,184
<i>This would've been a lot harder</i>
<i>if we'd actually fucked.</i>

333
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,410
<i>Was it you?</i>

334
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,580
<i>Right.</i>

335
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,541
<i>Fuck you, Jackie.</i>

336
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,680
<i>It's 100 bpms. Ah, this...</i>

337
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,475
<i>Ah, I lost count. Okay. Let's try again.</i>

338
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,436
<i>You just wasted $300 worth of blow.</i>

339
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,521
<i>A, I will Venmo you.</i>

340
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:40,192
<i>And B, I couldn't just sit there</i>

341
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:43,528
<i>and watch you destroy your life.</i>

342
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,948
<i>"Watch"? Watch me?</i>

343
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:52,037
<i>I-I'll do a 15, 14-- no, 15 count,</i>

344
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,331
<i>- and then I'll multiply by four.</i>
<i>- Uh...</i>

345
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,670
<i>What?</i>

346
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,130
<i>You were spying on me?</i>

347
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:05,050
<i>Is that what you were doing, you little pervert?</i>

348
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:08,678
<i>Did you watch me and Kevyn fuck?</i>

349
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,764
<i>No, that was not the point.</i>

350
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,891
<i>Friends watch out for each other.</i>

351
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,351
<i>Not with hidden cameras, they don't.</i>

352
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,811
<i>What the fuck is your problem?</i>

353
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,479
<i>What do you want from me? I knew</i>

354
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,897
<i>- I couldn't trust you.</i>
<i>- You know what?</i>

355
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,566
<i>I just saved you from relapsing.</i>

356
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:24,694
<i>Who else was gonna do that, Natalie? Huh?</i>

357
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,738
<i>I'm pretty much the best</i>
<i>friend you have right now.</i>

358
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,741
<i>And that's not much of a competition, is it? </i>

359
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,660
<i>You should be thanking me.</i>

360
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:35,080
<i>I have been working day</i>
<i>and night on Travis's case.</i>

361
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,249
<i>You have no idea</i>

362
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,167
<i>the lengths that I have gone to</i>

363
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,919
<i>to solve that case.</i>

364
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:44,339
<i>Did you know that Travis's</i>
<i>bank account was emptied out</i>

365
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,591
<i>the day after he died?</i>

366
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:49,219
<i>Stop it. How do I, how can I trust you?</i>

367
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,471
<i>- You're so full of shit!</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

368
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,098
<i>You know what? Fine.</i>

369
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,768
<i>Next time, I will just let</i>
<i>you zonk your brains out.</i>

370
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,980
<i>You know that I have never</i>
<i>even tried cocaine before?</i>

371
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,107
<i>Oh, which is what I hope that was, because,</i>

372
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:05,569
<i>oh, if that was PCP, or bath salts, or-or heroin,</i>

373
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,112
<i>or, fuck, fentanyl,</i>

374
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:11,158
<i>then I-I will probably be dead in a few minutes.</i>

375
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,034
<i>But... but you know what?</i>

376
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:16,121
<i>I was willing to take that risk for you.</i>

377
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,721
<i>You expecting someone?</i>

378
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,473
<i>No.</i>

379
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,036
<i>Look who it is.</i>

380
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,496
<i>We got a celebrity in our midst.</i>

381
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:58,830
<i>Ta-da? </i>

382
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,832
<i>- Hi.</i>
<i>- I was canvassing</i>

383
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,084
<i>in the neighborhood, and I remembered that you...</i>

384
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:05,879
<i>you used to live around here,</i>
<i>so I-I thought I'd pop by.</i>

385
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:10,217
<i>Yeah. It's-it's a nice surprise after 20 years.</i>

386
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:11,593
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

387
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,220
<i>Um, I'm sorry.</i>

388
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,679
<i>You're obviously in the middle of dinner. I'm...</i>

389
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,598
<i>Well, yeah, but... No, no, no, no, no.</i>

390
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,600
<i>She can stay. Please. We're...</i>

391
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,685
<i>- we're... Yeah, join us.</i>
<i>- Oh, no, no, no.</i>

392
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,484
<i>I'm sleepwalking again.</i>

393
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,653
<i>How long for?</i>

394
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,988
<i>Couple of weeks, I think.</i>

395
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:36,034
<i>It's mostly stress, uh, the campaign, and...</i>

396
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:42,374
<i>...this goddamn blackmail fiasco, and...</i>

397
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:45,377
<i>Not to mention, Simone and I...</i>

398
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,462
<i>have been having some problems.</i>

399
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,714
<i>How bad is it?</i>

400
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,760
<i>Biscuit's missing.</i>

401
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,847
<i>That's our dog.</i>

402
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,475
<i>I must have freaked him out, and he got out</i>

403
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,102
<i>- the back gate, and...</i>
<i>- Oh.</i>

404
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,896
<i>Sammy loves the shit out of that dog.</i>

405
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,650
<i>Jesus Christ, I'm really fucking this kid up.</i>

406
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,777
<i>- No, Tai...</i>

407
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,989
<i>He's seen me do it, Shauna. He's seen me do it.</i>

408
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:17,242
<i>He thinks there's some other version of me.</i>

409
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,703
<i>He calls it "the bad one."</i>

410
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:32,632
<i>I'm afraid to go to sleep.</i>

411
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:37,512
<i>I spent the night pounding espressos,</i>

412
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:42,058
<i>just so I can stay in control.</i>

413
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,520
<i>I don't know how bad it's</i>
<i>gonna get this time, but you...</i>

414
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:48,106
<i>you know how bad it can get.</i>

415
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,443
<i>Yeah.</i>

416
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,445
<i>I just need some fucking sleep.</i>

417
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:58,742
<i>Hey. Why don't you just stay here tonight?</i>

418
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,452
<i>Callie's not here.</i>

419
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:03,455
<i>You can sleep in her room.</i>
<i>She's at her friend Ilana's.</i>

420
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,250
<i>I'll stay with you.</i>

421
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,592
<i>Yeah.</i>

422
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:31,232
<i>Oh, my God. What happened?</i>

423
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,443
<i>Where are Van and Tai?</i>

424
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,862
<i>- Hey, hey.</i>

425
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,656
<i>She... </i>

426
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:39,741
<i>She told, she told us to leave them.</i>

427
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,619
<i>We had to get help.</i>

428
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,000
<i>Show us which way to go.</i>

429
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:54,297
<i>- Tai?</i>
<i>- Van?</i>

430
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,674
<i>Van!</i>

431
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,300
<i>Taissa?</i>

432
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,177
<i>Taissa!</i>

433
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,847
<i>- Van!</i>
<i>- Van!</i>

434
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,809
<i>Taissa!</i>

435
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,269
<i>Are you sure you came this way?</i>

436
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,105
<i>I...</i>

437
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:12,732
<i>I don't know. I-I can't see anything.</i>

438
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,943
<i>It's so dark.</i>

439
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,448
<i>- It's them.</i>

440
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,309
<i>Hey, it's gonna be okay.</i>

441
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,564
<i>We're gonna get you all fixed up, okay?</i>

442
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:55,734
<i>- It's gonna be okay.</i>

443
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,532
<i>Okay, so, make sure that you're angled in...</i>

444
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,491
<i>Misty, I think she's got it.</i>

445
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,164
<i>- Okay. </i>

446
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,665
<i>Uh...</i>

447
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,713
<i>- Okay.</i>

448
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,382
<i>- Oh...</i>

449
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:48,912
<i>Do you ever think about</i>

450
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,831
<i>what our lives would've been like</i>

451
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:55,835
<i>if, um, you know,</i>

452
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,754
<i>it didn't happen?</i>

453
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,006
<i>Yeah, sometimes.</i>

454
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,136
<i>Well, I was going to go to Brown.</i>

455
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,304
<i>Wow.</i>

456
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,723
<i>I was gonna write amazing papers</i>

457
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:12,936
<i>on Dorothy Parker and Virginia Woolf.</i>

458
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:16,147
<i>Thought I would meet, like, a floppy-haired,</i>

459
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:19,317
<i>sad-eyed poet boy who ran</i>

460
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,569
<i>- the school lit magazine.</i>

461
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:22,821
<i>Ah.</i>

462
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,656
<i>He was gonna be, like, so smart.</i>

463
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,491
<i>- Oh, God.</i>
<i>- And a little bit</i>

464
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,826
<i>intimidated by me.</i>

465
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,410
<i>We were gonna be, like, full rivals</i>

466
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:30,954
<i>- until we weren't, you know?</i>
<i>- Yes. Yes. </i>

467
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,497
<i>- That kind of thing.</i>

468
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,999
<i>But then my short stories</i>

469
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,501
<i>would make him fall in love with me anyway.</i>

470
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,044
<i>Yeah.</i>

471
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,004
<i>Then, at some point, I would have to leave him</i>

472
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,464
<i>- brokenhearted, because...</i>
<i>- Oh, no.</i>

473
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,882
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- Aw.</i>

474
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,175
<i>'Cause I'm gonna take my year abroad.</i>

475
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,510
<i>- Oh.</i>
<i>- And that's where</i>

476
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,970
<i>I meet Francois.</i>

477
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,847
<i>I'm sorry, "Francois"?</i>

478
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:49,848
<i>Yeah, in France.</i>

479
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,017
<i>Yeah.</i>

480
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,353
<i>Oh, please tell me Francois was some sort of</i>

481
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,896
<i>brooding musician.</i>

482
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,815
<i>No. Francois was a mime.</i>

483
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,692
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

484
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,735
<i>- Miming is a serious art form</i>

485
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,529
<i>- in France.</i>
<i>- Okay. Yeah.</i>

486
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,114
<i>Okay. </i>

487
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:10,201
<i>Well, I was going to go to Howard.</i>

488
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:13,997
<i>Pre-law, with a double major</i>
<i>in history and philosophy.</i>

489
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,958
<i>And date a bunch of beautiful women,</i>

490
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,794
<i>make first string on the soccer team,</i>

491
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,463
<i>graduate first-- first in my class.</i>

492
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:26,175
<i>And then I was gonna go to Columbia Law</i>

493
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,887
<i>and land an internship</i>

494
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:32,265
<i>in one of the biggest firms in the city. </i>

495
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,894
<i>You did do all those things.</i>

496
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:41,107
<i>Yeah.</i>

497
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:46,070
<i>But if I'm being honest,</i>

498
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:49,741
<i>not a single one of those things felt...</i>

499
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,910
<i>real.</i>

500
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:04,589
<i>No, I don't have his account password.</i>

501
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,300
<i>That's the thing, because...</i>

502
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:11,679
<i>Well, please, could you just talk to your manager</i>

503
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,223
<i>and, um, and just tell them</i>

504
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:18,102
<i>that I'm-I'm not his family,</i>
<i>but I'm pretty much...</i>

505
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:23,274
<i>You're not listening. Can you just help-help me?</i>

506
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:26,110
<i>Please? No?</i>

507
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,571
<i>Can you fucking help me?!</i>

508
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:32,075
<i>What the fuck!? Talk to your manager!</i>

509
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,243
<i>You fucking bitch!</i>

510
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:37,246
<i>Do you believe in love?!</i>

511
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:40,959
<i>Talk to your fucking manager!</i>

512
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,096
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

513
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,475
<i>You're kidding.</i>

514
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,400
<i>Why, yes, it is.</i>

515
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,328
<i>Hey, Misty.</i>

516
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,165
<i>So this is the deal.</i>

517
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,793
<i>Either you are gonna let me go</i>

518
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,629
<i>right fucking now...</i>

519
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,632
<i>or I'm gonna wring your little boyfriend's neck.</i>

520
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,969
<i>Swear to you, I'll fucking do it.</i>

521
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:38,099
<i>Fine. Go ahead.</i>

522
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,393
<i>I'll just get another one.</i>

523
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:44,147
<i>Fine. I will.</i>

524
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,574
<i>Oh, my baby.</i>

525
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,075
<i>My poor little boy.</i>

526
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,910
<i>I didn't mean a word of it.</i>

527
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,662
<i>I didn't mean it.</i>

528
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:31,027
<i>- You look like hell.</i>

529
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,361
<i>Are you okay?</i>

530
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,988
<i>I'm fine.</i>

531
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,910
<i>I'm just having one of those days.</i>

532
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,262
<i>Are you hungry?</i>

533
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,057
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

534
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,059
<i>I'm gonna make us something to eat.</i>

535
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,988
<i>I let the fire die down.</i>

536
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,451
<i>I fell asleep.</i>

537
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:26,290
<i>And I must have been sleepwalking or something,</i>

538
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:29,418
<i>because when I woke up,</i>

539
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,630
<i>I was in a fucking tree, and...</i>

540
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:40,179
<i>I'm the reason she went.</i>

541
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,433
<i>And I'm the reason she got hurt.</i>

542
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,352
<i>No...</i>

543
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,817
<i>I don't know what's happening to me, Shauna.</i>

544
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,236
<i>I'm scared to go to sleep.</i>

545
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:58,322
<i>Then I'll stay awake, okay?</i>

546
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,701
<i>And I won't let you go anywhere.</i>

547
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,042
<i>Shh.</i>

548
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:12,044
<i>You'll be fine.</i>

549
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,508
<i>I'm having an affair.</i>

550
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,261
<i>What?</i>

551
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,305
<i>Sorry. I don't know why I told you that.</i>

552
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:25,766
<i>Oh, my God. Don't be sorry. With who?</i>

553
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,268
<i>Oh, shit, wait.</i>

554
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,270
<i>Oh, my God, if you say Randy Walsh,</i>

555
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,022
<i>I am gonna burn this whole fucking town down.</i>

556
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:34,775
<i>It's just this, um, guy I met.</i>

557
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,819
<i>He's younger.</i>

558
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,155
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

559
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,200
<i>What is he like?</i>

560
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,952
<i>- His name's Adam.</i>
<i>- Mm.</i>

561
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:48,873
<i>Um, he's an artist.</i>

562
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:52,543
<i>He's really earnest.</i>

563
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,795
<i>Mm.</i>

564
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,464
<i>In-in a way that, like,</i>

565
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,132
<i>kind of makes you want to punch his face.</i>

566
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:02,094
<i>But also, sometimes I'm like, "Yeah."</i>

567
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,350
<i>And he just makes me feel something.</i>

568
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,771
<i>Like, the sex is...</i>

569
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,356
<i>it's great, but...</i>

570
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,400
<i>But it's more than that.</i>

571
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:20,112
<i>Yeah. He makes you feel "it."</i>

572
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,572
<i>Yeah.</i>

573
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:22,698
<i>Yeah. I know.</i>

574
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,495
<i>Ah, man, I remember that.</i>

575
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:31,832
<i>Simone doesn't make you feel "it" anymore?</i>

576
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:34,210
<i>No.</i>

577
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,588
<i>But you know what? It's okay.</i>

578
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:42,468
<i>What we have is different.</i>
<i>It's stable. It's safe.</i>

579
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,595
<i>And-and... and I like that.</i>

580
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,597
<i>It just, um...</i>

581
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,725
<i>you know, "it"-- whatever that really means--</i>

582
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,019
<i>it-it wasn't any good for me.</i>

583
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:55,022
<i>It's like if someone made me feel "it"...</i>

584
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:59,610
<i>...it wasn't gonna be good for anybody, you know?</i>

585
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:05,700
<i>- Yeah.</i>

586
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:09,078
<i>I think I do.</i>

587
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,681
<i>My turn.</i>

588
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,850
<i>Ah. Okay.</i>

589
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:33,060
<i>- Hi.</i>
<i>- Hi.</i>

590
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,607
<i>Oh. These...</i>

591
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:43,571
<i>So, uh, I was just thinking, and, um,</i>

592
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:46,657
<i>our interactions have been so kind of, uh...</i>

593
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,201
<i>- how should I put it...</i>
<i>- Hot.</i>

594
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:51,704
<i>...singularly focused,</i>

595
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:56,500
<i>that, uh, I realized I don't</i>
<i>know anything about you.</i>

596
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,421
<i>I seem to recall you mocked</i>
<i>all my efforts on that front,</i>

597
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,257
<i>but yeah, sure. What do you want to know?</i>

598
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:08,304
<i>How about you tell me more about...</i>

599
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,474
<i>your art school days?</i>

600
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,893
<i>You went to Pratt, right?</i>

601
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,227
<i>What was that like?</i>

602
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:17,104
<i>Oh...</i>

603
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:20,274
<i>I mean, pretentious, mostly.</i>

604
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,656
<i>What classes did you take?</i>

605
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:32,036
<i>Who was your favorite professor?</i>

606
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,164
<i>Um...</i>

607
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,166
<i>Okay.</i>

608
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,918
<i>I take it you did some digging,</i>

609
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,711
<i>and you caught me.</i>

610
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,547
<i>Yeah, I didn't go to Pratt,</i>

611
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,758
<i>but I had a girlfriend who went there, Lauren,</i>

612
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,844
<i>and I spent so much time</i>
<i>with her and her friends,</i>

613
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,055
<i>that it kind of felt like I went there.</i>

614
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,932
<i>Um...</i>

615
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:55,393
<i>Uh, look, I-I just told you</i>
<i>'cause I wanted to impress you.</i>

616
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,604
<i>Did it?</i>

617
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,150
<i>Where did you grow up?</i>

618
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,860
<i>Suburbs of Houston.</i>

619
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:05,986
<i>High school?</i>

620
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,072
<i>Milby High, class of '04. Go, Buffs.</i>

621
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:10,074
<i>- Do you have any siblings?</i>
<i>- An older brother.</i>

622
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,576
<i>- Where is he now?</i>
<i>- Ann Arbor, Michigan.</i>

623
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:15,037
<i>He's a colorectal surgeon.</i>

624
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,332
<i>And he has this book in his house</i>

625
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:21,001
<i>that's just called Anus.</i>

626
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,754
<i>I'm a ten-year-old,</i>

627
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,756
<i>but it still makes me laugh.</i>

628
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,092
<i>Okay, um, as much as I would love...</i>

629
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,220
<i>...to believe you finally</i>
<i>want to get to know me...</i>

630
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,931
<i>Why don't you tell me what this is really about?</i>

631
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:37,101
<i>Are you trying to catch me lying about things?</i>

632
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:39,937
<i>'Cause I swear it was just</i>
<i>the stupid Pratt thing.</i>

633
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,564
<i>It's a crazy thing to lie about.</i>

634
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,442
<i>Well...  I know. I'm sorry.</i>

635
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:48,070
<i>But the rest of it, Shauna, us,</i>

636
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,281
<i>that's real.</i>

637
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:52,450
<i>Look, I've got this friend</i>

638
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,743
<i>with a cabin in the woods in the Poconos.</i>

639
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:57,288
<i>Let's go away for the weekend.</i>

640
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:59,331
<i>Okay? I'll be an open book.</i>

641
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,125
<i>You can ask me anything.</i>

642
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,543
<i>My first kiss,</i>

643
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,462
<i>my favorite color, my shoe size. I don't know.</i>

644
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,755
<i>Whatever you want. Ask me anything.</i>

645
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,801
<i>How do you propose I explain that?</i>

646
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,097
<i>I don't give a shit.</i>

647
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,602
<i>Just go pack a bag,</i>

648
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,687
<i>and get back here.</i>

649
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,962
<i>I have an announcement.</i>

650
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,468
<i>- Hello!</i>

651
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,721
<i>- Hi! Excuse me!</i>

652
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,016
<i>Thank you.</i>

653
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:02,520
<i>In light of the expedition ending as it did,</i>

654
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,563
<i>I have decided that I'm going to take</i>

655
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,315
<i>the dead guy's plane and fly south.</i>

656
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,983
<i>I'm going to find us help,</i>

657
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,152
<i>and I'm going to get us out of here.</i>

658
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,071
<i>You're gonna fly?</i>

659
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:15,115
<i>But y-you don't know how.</i>

660
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:17,493
<i>I've been studying the flight manual for weeks,</i>

661
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,620
<i>and I checked the gas tank, it's full.</i>

662
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:20,871
<i>I used to watch my grandpa fly.</i>

663
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,540
<i>He even let me steer a few times.</i>

664
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:25,125
<i>I know that I can do this.</i>

665
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:28,087
<i>You can't deny that Van needs</i>
<i>serious medical attention.</i>

666
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,592
<i>She's not the only one.</i>

667
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:39,306
<i>Shauna, tell them.</i>

668
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,891
<i>I-I really don't...</i>

669
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,017
<i>Tell them.</i>

670
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,061
<i>- What is it?</i>
<i>- Yeah, tell us what?</i>

671
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,067
<i>I'm-I'm pregnant.</i>

672
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,278
<i>You were having sex?</i>

673
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,029
<i>- How far along are you?</i>
<i>- Wait,</i>

674
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,864
<i>did you get knocked up here?</i>

675
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:56,907
<i>No, I...</i>

676
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,409
<i>It doesn't matter when it happened.</i>

677
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,786
<i>Okay? It just matters that we get them both help.</i>

678
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,288
<i>- Let me just...</i>
<i>- Misty, not right now.</i>

679
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:04,164
<i>All right. Can everyone just...</i>

680
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,125
<i>Laura Lee,</i>

681
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,918
<i>you can't do this.</i>

682
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,296
<i>No. I-It's not even close to safe.</i>

683
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,631
<i>There is no "safe" anymore, Coach Scott.</i>

684
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,758
<i>It's going to be winter soon.</i>

685
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,594
<i>If I don't do this, we're...</i>

686
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,055
<i>We're all gonna fucking starve.</i>

687
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,020
<i>All right, well,</i>

688
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,938
<i>I'm still the only adult here,</i>

689
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,357
<i>so, no.</i>

690
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,525
<i>I'm not gonna let you do it.</i>

691
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,032
<i>What are you gonna do to stop me, Coach?</i>

692
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,596
<i>Hello, I'm an addict, and my name is Jim.</i>

693
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:01,930
<i>Hi, Jim.</i>

694
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:02,848
<i>Welcome to the Chelsea Morning group</i>

695
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,600
<i>of Narcotics Anonymous.</i>

696
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,894
<i>I'd like to start the meeting</i>
<i>with a moment of silence</i>

697
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:09,063
<i>for the addicts who are still suffering,</i>

698
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:11,690
<i>and then we'll do the Lord's Prayer.</i>

699
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,120
<i>Oh, Jesus Christ,</i>

700
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,456
<i>- not you.</i>

701
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,501
<i>Come on. I promise</i>

702
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:32,961
<i>- I won't assault you again.</i>

703
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,924
<i>Um, the last I heard,</i>

704
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:39,677
<i>you got a promotion at the bank.</i>

705
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:42,805
<i>What's it to you, Natalie?</i>
<i>I haven't seen you in ten years.</i>

706
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:44,848
<i>Come on. You were my best sponsor.</i>

707
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,476
<i>I just got out of rehab,</i>

708
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,436
<i>and I wanted to see you.</i>

709
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,980
<i>Why?</i>

710
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,190
<i>I have something</i>

711
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:55,025
<i>I really need to talk to you about,</i>

712
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:57,903
<i>and nobody could understand things like you.</i>

713
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,658
<i>Please?</i>

714
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:06,954
<i>So, you remember that guy...</i>

715
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:09,915
<i>...that I used to always talk about?</i>

716
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:12,710
<i>Who was in the plane crash with me?</i>

717
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:16,880
<i>Trevor?</i>

718
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:19,258
<i>Travis.</i>

719
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,386
<i>He died.</i>

720
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,805
<i>And the cops</i>

721
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:27,349
<i>ruled it a suicide,</i>

722
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:30,769
<i>but I know it wasn't.</i>

723
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:33,272
<i>And why is that, Natalie?</i>

724
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:38,235
<i>Because he made me a promise.</i>

725
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,571
<i>And when I was on</i>

726
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:43,323
<i>the brink... </i>

727
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:45,159
<i>...he, um...</i>

728
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:51,206
<i>He made me swear</i>

729
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:54,543
<i>that I would never do that, and then...</i>

730
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:58,046
<i>he promised me the same.</i>

731
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:01,675
<i>And even though my words... </i>

732
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,761
<i>...don't mean much...</i>

733
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:06,305
<i>I-I know I'm a liar.</i>

734
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:09,349
<i>He always kept his word.</i>

735
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:11,727
<i>Always.</i>

736
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:16,648
<i>I know he didn't kill himself.</i>

737
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:24,656
<i>For once, I think you're</i>
<i>actually telling me the truth.</i>

738
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:28,577
<i>I need your help, Suze.</i>

739
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,038
<i>Somebody closed</i>

740
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,290
<i>Travis's bank account</i>

741
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:34,875
<i>after he died,</i>

742
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:38,253
<i>and I need to find out who, or</i>

743
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,880
<i>- where that money went...</i>
<i>- I'm sorry. I just,</i>

744
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:42,007
<i>I can't give out personal account information,</i>

745
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,968
<i>unless you're family. I mean, I could get fired.</i>

746
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:47,971
<i>I thought you might say that.</i>

747
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:50,891
<i>Well...</i>

748
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:54,228
<i>I guess I'm gonna have to call the bank then</i>

749
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:55,771
<i>and tell them</i>

750
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,481
<i>how you and I</i>

751
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:59,817
<i>used to feed our habits</i>

752
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:02,486
<i>by selling your customers'</i>

753
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,655
<i>personal information</i>

754
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:07,199
<i>to identity thieves.</i>

755
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:11,161
<i>I think they'd be really interested to know that.</i>

756
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:16,416
<i>Or they could just be really impressed</i>

757
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,960
<i>by your personal growth.</i>

758
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:24,550
<i>I wish I'd never fucking met you.</i>

759
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:50,868
<i>Did you really have to tell everyone?</i>

760
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:53,871
<i>I mean, how could I not?</i>

761
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:57,165
<i>Shauna, we have the chance to get you</i>

762
00:47:57,207 --> 00:48:00,878
<i>and the baby out of here.</i>

763
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:03,338
<i>That's all that matters. It's...</i>

764
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,257
<i>It's not really the time to be keeping secrets.</i>

765
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:55,641
<i>After the crash,</i>

766
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:58,769
<i>when we were stuck out there,</i>
<i>I started sleepwalking.</i>

767
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:02,397
<i>A symptom of the trauma, I guess.</i>

768
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:05,901
<i>Once we were rescued, it just... just stopped.</i>

769
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,362
<i>But with the stress</i>

770
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:10,906
<i>of the campaign, and everything that's been</i>

771
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,116
<i>going on, um,</i>

772
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:15,369
<i>it started happening again.</i>

773
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,995
<i>No, uh...</i>

774
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,580
<i>It's not just happening,</i>

775
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:21,166
<i>I'm doing it, and it, and it,</i>
<i>and it fucking scares me</i>

776
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,418
<i>because the last time, I...</i>

777
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,463
<i>I... Um...</i>

778
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,717
<i>I think I may have been the one</i>

779
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:33,470
<i>to let Biscuit out of the house.</i>

780
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,140
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

781
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:41,144
<i>It's okay.</i>

782
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:43,313
<i>- It's okay, baby.</i>

783
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,857
<i>- It's okay. I know, it's okay.</i>
<i>- No. </i>

784
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:49,736
<i>It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.</i>

785
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:51,863
<i>Baby, baby, baby.</i>

786
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:54,282
<i>Okay? It's okay.</i>

787
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,576
<i>We will get you help. Whatever you need, okay?</i>

788
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:57,786
<i>Mm.</i>

789
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,621
<i>And we can, um,</i>

790
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,957
<i>I don't know, find you a sleep study...</i>

791
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,583
<i>What I really need is for you and Sammy</i>

792
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,627
<i>to go stay at your mom's house</i>
<i>for a little while.</i>

793
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:08,005
<i>What? Why?</i>

794
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:09,339
<i>I-I just think it would be</i>

795
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:10,924
<i>better for everybody involved</i>

796
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,676
<i>- if you and...</i>
<i>- No, Taissa, Taissa,</i>

797
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:14,261
<i>- we're a family.</i>
<i>- Simone...</i>

798
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:15,512
<i>We're not gonna leave you. We're gonna support...</i>

799
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,639
<i>Simone, Simone, you can't be here!</i>

800
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,850
<i>I don't think I'm making myself clear.</i>

801
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:22,185
<i>You don't understand. I'm afraid</i>
<i>I'm going to hurt you...</i>

802
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:24,521
<i>...or Sammy.</i>

803
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:26,148
<i>Please, baby.</i>

804
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:27,691
<i>Please. Please.</i>

805
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,860
<i>I am begging you. Please.</i>

806
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:32,696
<i>Please, just go.</i>

807
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,880
<i>Got any more good ideas?</i>

808
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,091
<i>We look for an asshole covered in glitter.</i>

809
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:36,510
<i>Wait until you hear the water running,</i>

810
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:37,928
<i>count to ten,</i>

811
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:41,098
<i>and then just get out, okay?</i>

812
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:05,163
<i>Who the fuck are you?</i>

813
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,488
<i>Be safe, okay?</i>

814
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,198
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

815
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:19,112
<i>For God's sake, Laura Lee, please.</i>

816
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,531
<i>Don't do this.</i>

817
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:26,453
<i>Thanks for worrying about me, Coach, but...</i>

818
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:29,748
<i>this is my purpose.</i>

819
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:37,797
<i>Just you and me now, Leonard.</i>

820
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:25,679
<i>Okay. Okay, that's good.</i>

821
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,555
<i>We need to get to 55 before we take off.</i>

822
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:30,267
<i>Kind of like Back to the Future, remember?</i>

823
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:45,240
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

824
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,866
<i>Leonard, we're flying.</i>

825
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:50,120
<i>- Oh, my God. She's doing it!</i>

826
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:15,645
<i>Oh, my God. We're really gonna save them.</i>

827
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,780
<i>What the...</i>

828
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:32,162
<i>No. No.</i>

829
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:40,503
<i>Is that smoke?</i>
