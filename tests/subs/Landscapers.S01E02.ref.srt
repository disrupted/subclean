1
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:47,791
<i>Just remember.</i>

2
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:52,666
One step at a time, like we said.

3
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:57,208
They arrest us, they read us our rights.

4
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,375
We know what we're gonna say.
We've gone through it

5
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:02,416
a thousand times, and we're ready.

6
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:07,041
Just don't say a word without a solicitor.

7
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:08,166
Right?

8
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:10,541
And remember,

9
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,791
you're in charge.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,500
<i>Then come the police interviews.</i>

11
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:18,458
<i>They'll try to confuse you,</i>

12
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:19,750
<i>but don't let them.</i>

13
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:26,000
<i>Just tell our story...</i>

14
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:27,333
<i>simply...</i>

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,250
<i>and calmly.</i>

16
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,125
<i>No need to make anything up.</i>

17
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:37,083
<i>Just tell them the truth.</i>

18
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:46,958
<i>Uh-- Hello there? Mrs. Edwards.</i>

19
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,791
<i>Oh, hello, it's Susan Edwards.</i>

20
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,125
<i>I understand you're being offered as my, um--</i>

21
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:51,791
<i>Yes, that's right. My name is Douglas Hylton.</i>

22
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,041
<i>And I'll be coming in to help you tonight,</i>

23
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,125
<i>- Mrs. Edwards.</i>
- Oh, good,

24
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:55,333
<i>because you've heard, I think,</i>

25
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,208
<i>that my husband and I have got ourselves</i>

26
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,375
<i>into a bit of a pickle.</i>

27
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:02,000
<i>I know it sounds all rather morbid.</i>

28
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,541
<i>Sus-- Susan? Susan? Sorry, can I just--</i>

29
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,791
<i>So, I feel, for his sake,</i>
<i>everyone should know the truth</i>

30
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,375
<i>- from the outset--</i>
- <i>Uh... Uh--</i>

31
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:08,708
<i>Susan? This isn't a private call</i>

32
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:10,875
<i>because I'm not actually your representative yet.</i>

33
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:12,416
<i>Uh-- That's what I'm coming to do now,</i>

34
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,791
<i>you see, to take your instruction,</i>

35
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:15,291
<i>and then I can-- Does that make sense?</i>

36
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,208
<i>I see, yes, sorry, silly old me.</i>

37
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:22,291
Just tell our story, simply...

38
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:24,250
and calmly.

39
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,958
No need to make anything up.

40
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:31,208
Just tell them the truth.

41
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,166
Thank you.

42
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,583
- Morning, Susan!
- Oh, you came back, then!

43
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,750
- How was your night?
- Oh, you know.

44
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,458
Yeah, first night's the worst.

45
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,166
Uh... The waiting...

46
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,250
Yeah. And also, the-- just not being with Chris,

47
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,708
even though he's just down the corridor.

48
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,041
- Very peculiar.

49
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,125
- Yeah, that's--
- Still, not for long, though.

50
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,083
- Huh?
- Sorry.

51
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,333
Oh. Thank you.

52
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,541
Um-- Douglas, I was wondering...

53
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:32,958
You know your advice

54
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,750
about not telling the police anything?

55
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,750
Is that because you don't believe us?

56
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,875
Um-- No. It's just to keep it simple,

57
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,125
uh, so that we don't get tripped up.

58
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,958
Uh-- To be honest, it's not my job

59
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,791
to have an opinion, really.

60
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,125
Uh-- My job is-- is to help you.

61
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,208
So when the police start asking questions,

62
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,375
I just ignore them?

63
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,875
You simply let them know
you prefer not to answer.

64
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,541
Uh... You know, most people like
to go with "No comment."

65
00:04:58,625 --> 00:04:59,833
It's "No comment" to everything.

66
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:03,000
At-- At least until we know... more.

67
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,416
You've gotta remember,
they've only got until tonight

68
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,291
to convince the CPS
that they have enough evidence

69
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:13,375
to-- to win a trial or get an extension.

70
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,375
If you and Chris don't give them anything,

71
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,625
you might go free.

72
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,375
I can't promise, but it does happen.

73
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,833
Okay. So, "No comment."

74
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:25,041
And how do we let Chris know
that that's the new plan?

75
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:29,208
I... um, we-- we don't.

76
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,833
The police aren't...

77
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,958
mega-keen on suspects sharing tactics.

78
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:39,958
It's just Chris never said
anything about "No comment."

79
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,708
We agreed that we would just tell our story.

80
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,541
We would never have handed ourselves in

81
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,291
if we thought we had something to hide.

82
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,000
Okay. Um...

83
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,833
Tell you what.

84
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,333
How about we...

85
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,458
write a brief statement?

86
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,041
Just the basics. Um...

87
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,750
Your story in your words, very short,

88
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,833
which I'll read out, and after that--

89
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,375
- "No comment."
- Ah, got it.

90
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,958
Um...

91
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:16,791
Okay. So, go for it, as simply as you can.

92
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,250
Okay. Um...

93
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,958
The day before my parents' deaths,

94
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,916
I took a National Express coach

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,416
from Victoria Coach Station to Mansfield.

96
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,791
It was route number...

97
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,958
450 as it was then. It might have changed.

98
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,041
Uh-- Susan, sorry, could you slow down a bit?

99
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,208
Oh, sorry, sorry!

100
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,291
And we don't need the routes and so on.

101
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,375
- Just the important stuff.
- Oh, okay.

102
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,750
Ey up. How you feeling?

103
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,541
- Fucking wired, mate.
- Yeah? You look nervous.

104
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,416
Nah, I'm not nervous. I'm wired.

105
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,666
There's a difference.

106
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,500
It's like there's a little bit
of shit in my pants,

107
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,625
but I'm also really excited.

108
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,000
Well, all power to you, mate.

109
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:18,500
It's just, 15 years, long time
to get their story straight.

110
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:11,666
<i>Just tell our story, simply...</i>

111
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,791
<i>and calmly.</i>

112
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,208
<i>No need to make anything up.</i>

113
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,500
<i>Just tell them the truth.</i>

114
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,791
<i>"On the weekend of my parents' deaths,</i>

115
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,541
<i>in May 1998,</i>

116
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,250
<i>while my husband Christopher</i>
<i>was at our home in London,</i>

117
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:31,375
<i>I took the National Express coach number 450</i>

118
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,583
<i>from London to Mansfield</i>

119
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,833
<i>and visited my parents at their home--"</i>

120
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,125
<i>Well, that was the route number then.</i>

121
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,250
It might be different now,
the way these things go.

122
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:42,208
Um... "I--" "I took
the National Express coach
number 450

123
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:45,208
from London to Mansfield and visited my parents

124
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,416
at their home.

125
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,375
All I'm prepared to say is that, firstly,

126
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,125
I am not responsible for the death of my father,

127
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,291
William Wycherley.

128
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,375
I believe my mother,
Patricia Wycherley, shot him.

129
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,291
I will say that I did, in fact,

130
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,833
shoot and fatally injure my mother,

131
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,041
but only after severe provocation.

132
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:05,458
I was in a very fragile
state of mind at the time.

133
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:06,916
I would like to make it absolutely clear

134
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,250
that my husband, Christopher Edwards,

135
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,625
had nothing to do with the deaths of my parents.

136
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,458
He was only made aware of their deaths by me,

137
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,791
one week after the incident."

138
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:19,625
Signed and dated. As I've said,
it's my handwriting,

139
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,083
but it's my client's words.

140
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,541
Thank you, Mr. Hylton.

141
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,958
Susan, are these your words?

142
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,916
Does that reading accurately reflect

143
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,375
the content of your statement?

144
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,375
No comment.

145
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,083
Okay, Susan. If I go to the end of the statement,

146
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,916
- this your signature?
- No comment.

147
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,500
- It's okay, Susan, you can answer.
- Oh, sorry. Yes.

148
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,083
That's my signature, sorry.

149
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,083
That's all right, Susan.

150
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,000
Your statement's very helpful.

151
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,625
So, tell me. When you say
you went to visit your parents,

152
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,208
what was their address in Mansfield?

153
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,625
Five Braxton Close.

154
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,708
And at that time, you're 39?

155
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,875
- Just about to turn 40?
- Yes.

156
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:55,958
No comment.

157
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,666
Um-- Again, I must stress to you, Susan,

158
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,250
that although it's completely your decision,

159
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,458
my advice remains that you answer all questions,

160
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,500
- "No comment."
- Um... No comment.

161
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,041
I can see you're confused, Susan.

162
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,541
Your solicitor and I are coming
from different angles.

163
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:11,750
But I'm just trying to establish
some extremely basic facts.

164
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:15,291
So, if you want to, you can answer.

165
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,541
Right?

166
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,708
You say Christopher Edwards is your husband.

167
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,291
- When did you marry?
- No comment.

168
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,125
Can I ask why you're smiling?

169
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,708
Well, no comment.

170
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,208
- Whoa.
- So, we've uncovered

171
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,208
some slightly dodgy financial activity,

172
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,416
which I've got Sandra looking into,

173
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,041
and apparently they were friends
with Gérard Depardieu.

174
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,708
Whatever the fuck that has to do with anything.

175
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:47,666
Oh, hello again.

176
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,166
- You done?
- Yes.

177
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,875
Thank you, I-- I'm sorry.

178
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,708
Breakfast, um, isn't really my thing.

179
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,666
But my-- my compliments to the chef, though,

180
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,000
or whoever it is that prepares
the microwave packages.

181
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,583
'Cause scrambled eggs, they're not easy to do

182
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,625
in bulk, are they? They--
They often go hard, don't they?

183
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,458
You still going with that?

184
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,166
Oh, uh, no. All done.

185
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,416
Thank you.

186
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,791
Yeah, it was great! It wasn't what I excepted.

187
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,750
- Oh really?
- No!

188
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,625
<i>How-- How is it so late?</i>
<i>I've missed the last train!</i>

189
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,875
- Well, get a bus, or I'll help you with a taxi?
- It's already so late!

190
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,375
What's the panic? It's not the end of the world.

191
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:31,458
Look, well, I know it's silly,
But we-- we have this routine.

192
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,458
We usually have a hot--
a cup of hot chocolate together

193
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,291
at bedtime and talk about the day.

194
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,291
We've done it since
I was little, it's story time.

195
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,791
Only, I didn't tell him or Mom
that I was gonna be late,

196
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,416
so they'll be waiting up wanting to go to bed.

197
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,500
Well, just phone them, then.

198
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,375
But if they're sleeping, I'll wake them up.

199
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,958
Okay. How about this?

200
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,666
If you want, if it's easier
for your parents, I mean,

201
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,083
you can stay at mine tonight. I mean, I'm not--

202
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:56,083
No, uh, no funny business.

203
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:59,250
But I've got my mom staying, she's on the sofa.

204
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,208
It's a bit of a long story, but, uh...

205
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,750
Well, anyway,

206
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,041
I'll sleep on the floor. You can have my room.

207
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:06,750
Oh, I couldn't make you do that.

208
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,916
No, honestly, I'd be happy to.

209
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And then in the morning, I can help you get home.

210
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,750
Oh, Chris.

211
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,250
<i>Just to confirm one more time, Chris,</i>

212
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,333
<i>you are content for this interview to continue</i>

213
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,000
<i>without a solicitor?</i>

214
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,916
- <i>I am content.</i>

215
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,708
<i>I don't need someone who knows nothing about me</i>

216
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:48,000
<i>telling me when and when not to speak.</i>

217
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,083
Right, you understand you can change your mind

218
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:55,041
- on that at any time?
- So I've been told, yes.

219
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,791
In fact, people won't stop telling me.

220
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,041
Right, thank you.

221
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,625
I can't say I didn't know.

222
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,583
All right. Mr. Edwards, uh,

223
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:07,750
before we begin with specific questions,

224
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,500
is there anything you would like to tell us

225
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:13,791
from the outset, anything about
why you think you're here?

226
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,041
Hm. Yes, I would. Thank you.

227
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:20,333
Uh-- The following is an account
of the events as I recall them.

228
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:23,333
On a bank holiday weekend in May 1998,

229
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:26,625
my wife, Susan Edwards, took a coach from London

230
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:27,708
to visit her parents,

231
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,333
William and Patricia Wycherley, in Mansfield.

232
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:35,291
I myself remained at home in London.

233
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:39,083
Now, I went with my wife to Mansfield

234
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,375
<i>the following weekend and only then learned</i>

235
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,875
<i>of the tragic events that had transpired</i>

236
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:48,958
<i>the previous weekend,</i>
<i>i.e. the death of her parents.</i>

237
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,708
I wanted to ring the police, of course,

238
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:56,625
but my wife can be very fragile,
and she convinced me

239
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,291
that nobody would understand the complexity

240
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,333
of what had happened
and why she was not at fault.

241
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,958
That's when we, uh...

242
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,333
when we did what families
traditionally used to do,

243
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,416
still do in many parts of the world, in fact,

244
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,208
which is to inter them,

245
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:16,375
uh, respectfully in their own home, dwelling...

246
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,875
or domicile, if you will.

247
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:23,083
<i>I mean, the thing that's really</i>
<i>tortured me all these years,</i>

248
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,208
<i>is had I been with her</i>

249
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,166
<i>on that previous, fateful weekend,</i>

250
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,583
<i>none of this would have happened,</i>

251
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:29,750
<i>you can be sure of that.</i>

252
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,625
<i>And we wouldn't be sitting here right now,</i>

253
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,083
<i>you gentlemen and I, no.</i>

254
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,666
...before '84, everything's black and white.

255
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,958
<i>All right, one last question.</i>

256
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,125
Shut up!

257
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,291
<i>Do you happen to recall the coach company</i>

258
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,458
<i>you and Susan took up to Mansfield?</i>

259
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:45,833
<i>National Express. Route 450,</i>

260
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,833
<i>as it was then, it might have changed now,</i>

261
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,416
<i>the way these things go.</i>

262
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,291
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Well, I think we've covered</i>
<i>the crux of it,</i>

263
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,916
<i>so, um, we'll take a break there</i>
<i>and, uh, pick things up later,</i>

264
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,500
<i>- if you don't mind, Mr. Edwards.</i>
<i>- Happy to oblige.</i>

265
00:16:58,583 --> 00:16:59,958
- Happy to oblige

266
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,666
with the same bollocks Wifey's peddling.

267
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,541
Only difference is she's got a solicitor.

268
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,708
Yeah, but they've given us
a confession, haven't they?

269
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,250
Of sorts.

270
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,000
Uh-- Dear Christopher,

271
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,666
it was a big mistake to tell
your stepmother about the--

272
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,208
Shut it, Gérard!

273
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,666
What do you reckon they'd get if we take it, sir?

274
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,041
Not enough.

275
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,666
Financial stuff aside,
whatever fraud
they've committed...

276
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,041
...that's-- Oh, yeah, worth doing again.

277
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,125
It went so well the first fucking time.

278
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,500
That's Susan up
on loss of control manslaughter
for shooting her mom,

279
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:32,875
assuming that severe provocation
business holds up.

280
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,958
So, what, five years?

281
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,458
Eight at most. And Chris
is only getting a year or two,

282
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:38,750
- if that.
- For what?

283
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,583
Interfering with the duties of a coroner

284
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,041
or some vanilla crap like that.

285
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,791
Which is not bad
if they've actually committed
double murder.

286
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,583
Maybe not such idiots after all.

287
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,250
That story won't hold up
in court though, will it?

288
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,958
Bullet wounds like that.
It's one shooter, surely,

289
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,500
it's just a question of who.
I reckon we press him on that...

290
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,500
- Sir?
-...and then we can--

291
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,791
I wonder if we could try something.

292
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,541
- Mess with their heads a bit.
- Go on.

293
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,625
Could I handle both interviews, sir?

294
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:11,000
You've got big bollocks today,
don't you, Lancing?

295
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:12,958
Great.

296
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,291
This is your statement, Susan,

297
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,208
now labelled as item EL-06.

298
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:21,250
<i>We're glad to have it,</i>
<i>but it doesn't begin to explain</i>

299
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,500
<i>how your parents wound up dead</i>

300
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,750
<i>and buried in the garden, does it?</i>

301
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,625
<i>Do you have a question for my client?</i>

302
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,208
<i>Dozens. How did you first learn</i>

303
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,541
<i>your mother shot your father, Susan?</i>

304
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,166
<i>- Where were you?</i>
<i>- No comment.</i>

305
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,458
<i>Was it daytime or nighttime?</i>

306
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,625
<i>- No comment.</i>
- What about the gun? Whose was it?

307
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,208
- Had you seen it before?
- No comment.

308
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,333
- What'd you do with it afterwards?
- No comment.

309
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,416
- What'd you do with the bodies?
- No comment.

310
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,208
Did you wrap them in duvets?

311
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,625
Put them under the bed?

312
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,875
No comment.

313
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:53,208
Did you make a phone call around 2:00 a.m.?

314
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,375
Perhaps to your husband, Christopher?

315
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,291
Is-- Is Chris talking? What about his solicitor?

316
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,250
- “No--" "No comment.”
- You said he wouldn't talk!

317
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:04,875
Your husband's opted not to
take legal advice, Mrs. Edwards.

318
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,500
- Have you told him it's free?
- He knows it's free.

319
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:10,541
It's just he's chosen to be cooperative.

320
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:13,875
He's told my colleagues everything he can, Susan,

321
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,333
which makes me look a bit silly, to be honest.

322
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,458
I'm meant to be smart one,

323
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,041
but it's Bill and Ben in the other room

324
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:22,666
getting all the juicy stuff
from your very charming husband.

325
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,458
Only, he wasn't there, was he, Susan, that night?

326
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:31,083
So, we're inclined to think
he might be making it all up.

327
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,750
You do want us to know the truth, don't you?

328
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,291
- My advice remains--
- You said he wouldn't talk!

329
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,083
And how he's doing one thing
and I'm doing another,

330
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,083
and we're not together.

331
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,750
- I'm sorry.
- Um-- I'm sorry, Susan,

332
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,333
it's-- it's quite, um, strange,
honestly, but does Chris
know anything?

333
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,458
No, Chris is a very clever man.
You don't have to worry
about that.

334
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,791
- Perhaps you'd like to take a--
- No, I would not!

335
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,208
<i>Okay, Susan. Can we go back to the beginning?</i>

336
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,708
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

337
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,083
<i>Thank you. Let's break it down</i>

338
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,333
<i>- one step at a time, shall we?</i>
- Big balls.

339
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:14,625
Uh-- Uh-- Do you want me
to leave you alone for a bit?

340
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,000
Or-- Or I can show you where
to get some fresh air maybe.

341
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,583
Oh, I'm fine, thank you.

342
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,250
Okay.

343
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,791
You're doing really well.

344
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:31,208
- Am I?
- Yeah. Uh... Definitely.

345
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,666
Just... stay strong.

346
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,083
Try not to take the bait.

347
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,583
Okay.

348
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,541
It's October 31st, 2013.

349
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,875
The time is 13:31.

350
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,333
Interview with Christopher Edwards.

351
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,708
Hello, Mr. Edwards. How are you today?

352
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:57,875
Never better.

353
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:02,166
May I ask what happened
to the other two officers?

354
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,541
Something more important than this, apparently.

355
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:07,083
Very rude if you ask me, but anyway...

356
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,333
And thank you for providing

357
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:12,000
such a thorough account of the awful events

358
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,250
of May 1998.

359
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,041
It's a very sad story, Mr. Edwards.

360
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:19,041
It is, yes. I'm very happy to help.

361
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,916
Would you mind if we just review a few things?

362
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,375
Not at all, Detective Constable.

363
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,291
Susan was up with her parents in Mansfield,

364
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,666
you're at home in London,

365
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,083
- in Dagenham.

366
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,083
She rings you up in the middle of the night.

367
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:34,125
You answer. What does she say?

368
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,500
Nothing, really. She couldn't tell me anything.

369
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:37,958
She was too upset.

370
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,333
<i>Upset about what?</i>

371
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,708
I need you, Chris.

372
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:42,750
It's all wrong without you.

373
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,833
<i>Well, she'd had a terrible night.</i>

374
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,541
<i>Her mother was drunk, her father, abusive.</i>

375
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:50,041
<i>The usual story, I'm sad to say.</i>

376
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,625
I can't wait to get back...

377
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,875
to London.

378
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,208
<i>And the next time you see her, you say,</i>

379
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,416
<i>is the following Tuesday.</i>

380
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,041
<i>After the bank holiday Monday.</i>

381
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:21,375
- <i>Indeed.</i>
- <i>At Victoria Coach Station.</i>

382
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:22,750
<i>That's right.</i>

383
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,458
<i>You say she'd not told you anything</i>

384
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:25,958
<i>about what had happened, but was there anything</i>

385
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:29,750
<i>that struck you as unusual about her? Her mood?</i>

386
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:33,916
<i>Yes. She was odd. Quiet.</i>

387
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:35,916
<i>She said, uh...</i>

388
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:39,541
<i>What was it? Something like...</i>

389
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,375
It was the most awful weekend, Chris.

390
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:45,750
Really dreadful. I need a drink.

391
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:47,708
<i>...which was very unusual.</i>

392
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:50,625
<i>She almost never drinks.</i>

393
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:55,833
<i>I remember she asked for a port and brandy.</i>

394
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,291
Port and brandy?

395
00:22:58,333 --> 00:22:59,916
Uh... Yes.

396
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:01,958
Port and brandy.

397
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:05,375
For the nerves. Shot of brandy,
shot and a half of port.

398
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:06,708
Right.

399
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:12,000
Okay. Port and brandy.
And what did you have to drink?

400
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:15,958
Um... Well, I didn't want a drink.

401
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:20,166
I had a cup of tea. Earl Grey.

402
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,916
So, you go up to the house the next weekend,

403
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,666
week after Susan first went up.

404
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,916
She having said nothing that whole week

405
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,291
about having killed her parents.

406
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:30,250
About her mother killing her father.

407
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:31,500
About her killing her mother, then.

408
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:34,083
- She was provoked
- "Provoked." So you say.

409
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:37,000
- So she says.
- So you both say. Very neat.

410
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,166
Look...

411
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:40,250
I'm not gonna sit here

412
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:43,375
and pretend I don't know it's a defense.

413
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:47,500
Provocation. “Loss of control,”
you call it now, I believe.

414
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:50,000
Reducing murder to manslaughter.

415
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,750
I see you've done your homework.

416
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:54,541
It's a good thing
I have. You've just arrested
my wife for murder,

417
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,916
whereas in truth, all she's ever done is suffer.

418
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,500
And I don't think anyone

419
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,625
should go to prison for that, do you?

420
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:03,958
And as for that night, no, no,
she couldn't have shot them both

421
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:07,458
because she couldn't have done
anything to hurt her father!

422
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:09,416
I know her. I know her better than you.

423
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,333
He had too much power over her.

424
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,416
Trouble is,

425
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,833
it looks to us like your in-laws were both shot

426
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:22,833
from a similar angle,

427
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:24,458
perhaps by the same person.

428
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,875
Well, I don't know anything about that,

429
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:30,041
but Susan didn't lie to me.

430
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:34,958
Okay, so let's get back to you then, Mr. Edwards.

431
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,583
That following Friday,

432
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:39,208
you both take the coach up to Mansfield.

433
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:40,666
That is correct.

434
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,958
The Friday, right after I finished work.

435
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:44,500
And she still hasn't told you?

436
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:45,916
I'm getting to that.

437
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,666
It wasn't until we arrived at the house.

438
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,958
First, we picked up fish and chips.

439
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:52,583
We always have fish chips on Fridays.

440
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:54,833
It's just when I'm tucking in

441
00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:57,250
that Susan starts to act a bit different,

442
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:59,000
and suddenly, she says something like...

443
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:00,375
I can't stand it anymore.

444
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,583
They haven't gone away, they're upstairs.

445
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:05,000
And I'm, of course, you know,
"What are they doing upstairs?

446
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:07,625
Why don't they come down and say hello?"

447
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:10,791
Something like that. And then,
I don't remember the exact words

448
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:12,291
but then she said something like...

449
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:14,875
- Because they're dead.

450
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:18,166
And I'm, you know, “What do you mean?”

451
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,416
It's a surreal... disbelief thing.

452
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,750
I lose all interest in my haddock and chips.

453
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:26,041
And I love haddock and chips, it's my favorite.

454
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,375
A big deal, then.

455
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:30,166
Well, I've not had a single bite
of haddock since that day.

456
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,916
- Strictly cod.
- Isn't there a smell?

457
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:36,250
What? Oh, you mean the fish smell?

458
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:38,833
It was warm that week, we checked.

459
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:41,083
Yeah, but it was night when we
was eating our fish and chips.

460
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:44,166
The point is that the bodies
would've been lying there
for days.

461
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,916
Forgive the unpleasant image,
they're your in-laws after all,

462
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,583
but there would've been quite a stench.

463
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:51,250
Ah.

464
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:55,333
I, uh-- Yes, well, I know.
That's one of the, uh...

465
00:25:55,416 --> 00:25:59,666
But no, I didn't smell it, but Susan...

466
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:01,791
Susan said...

467
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:07,583
or well, later, I think she said
that there had been...

468
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:12,208
an awful smell, but no, I didn't...

469
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:14,041
notice it at the time...

470
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:17,791
myself.

471
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:19,916
Hard to explain, really,

472
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,750
except, of course, that the house always smelt

473
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:26,333
overwhelmingly of cigarettes
because of her parents.

474
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:39,625
- Oh!

475
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:43,875
Sandra!

476
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:49,041
Sandra! There you are.

477
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:51,291
- You're looking for me?
- Oh, yes, sir.

478
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:52,958
- Sorry.
- Why you apologizing?

479
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:54,833
I hear you've found
something good.
Just make it quick if you can.

480
00:26:54,916 --> 00:26:56,666
We're in the middle
of these interviews
at the minute.

481
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,625
I spent the morning at the branch in town.

482
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:00,791
- In the archive room.
- Oh, bank archives.

483
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:01,958
The glamour never stops, does it?

484
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:03,791
Yeah, it won't stop.

485
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:06,000
- Um-- But yeah. So--
- Excuse me.

486
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:09,291
Uh-- This is a bank statement
for a joint account.

487
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:11,083
Susan Edwards and Patricia Wycherley.

488
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:13,000
Right. And if you look over here,

489
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:14,958
that's the date the account was opened.

490
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:20,000
This is good, Sandra.
This is very good! Come with me!

491
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:26,291
Come here! Fuck's sake! I'm not gonna eat you!

492
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:28,500
<i>First of all, Susan, I'd like to introduce you</i>

493
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:30,291
<i>to officer Sandra Winters.</i>

494
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:32,708
- Hello.
- Officer Winters is a member

495
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:34,958
of our Forensic Financial Department.

496
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:36,458
Oh, my husband's an accountant.

497
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:38,500
Can you look at this bank document, please?

498
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:41,333
Police item CKA-04. Sandra.

499
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:45,250
Do you recognize that?

500
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:47,583
That's a bank account statement
showing the joint account

501
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,625
you opened in your name and your mom's.

502
00:27:49,708 --> 00:27:52,625
Can you read the date there,
please? Left-hand side.

503
00:27:52,708 --> 00:27:55,208
- Fifth of May.
- Fifth of May 1998.

504
00:27:56,416 --> 00:27:58,750
So, talk me through it.

505
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:01,583
You kill your mother, your father's dead as well.

506
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:03,125
You dispose of the gun. And then first thing

507
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:05,250
Tuesday morning, after the bank holiday,

508
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:08,750
9:17 a.m., to be specific,
you transfer a bank account

509
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:10,541
into you and your mother's names

510
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:12,333
and withdraw almost half of the funds.

511
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,750
- In cash.
- In cash.

512
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:18,708
Yes, I-- I...

513
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:20,333
ca-- can't remember.

514
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:23,166
You don't need to remember.
It's all there in the document.

515
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:28,708
Well, yes, uh, as I say, she's been, uh...

516
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:33,708
Sometimes, she's simply
economical with the truth.

517
00:28:33,791 --> 00:28:35,125
We all are sometimes.

518
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:37,583
But this. This is difficult.

519
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:40,583
It's straight after the killings. It's obscene.

520
00:28:40,666 --> 00:28:43,833
It's mercenary. And to be honest with you,

521
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:45,916
it's a little bit daft.

522
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,416
Well, I think she was obviously very--

523
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,458
It's not confusion, Chris, is it?

524
00:28:49,541 --> 00:28:51,500
Bang, bang, open a bank account?

525
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:54,208
Well, yes, I...

526
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:59,083
You said the word, I suppose.

527
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:02,000
"Mercenary," but...

528
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,583
Is there something you're not telling us, Chris?

529
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:11,083
Something that could help Susan perhaps?

530
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,541
Because at the moment,

531
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:15,125
this doesn't paint
a very pretty picture, does it?

532
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:26,500
It's...

533
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:30,666
It's a very personal matter.

534
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:32,791
Personal?

535
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:36,125
I'll tell you what's personal:
being shot in your own house,

536
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,291
kept under the bed for a week,

537
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:40,000
and buried in your own back yard for 15 years.

538
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,083
I'd like it on record...

539
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,333
that I don't think it's very fair

540
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:51,000
what I've just said about Susan...

541
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,500
or rather what you said.

542
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:57,875
It does her a grave disservice

543
00:29:57,958 --> 00:30:01,166
- to call her a mercenary.
- Why?

544
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:05,875
Because Susan...

545
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:08,166
...has always had...

546
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:12,916
much bigger things to worry about than money.

547
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:43,125
Right.

548
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,583
Clean sheets on yesterday,
in case you're wondering.

549
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:47,875
Here's a towel, toothbrush.

550
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:50,291
Thank you. Are you sure this is all right?

551
00:30:50,375 --> 00:30:52,416
Yeah, of course, yeah, yeah. It's my pleasure.

552
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,208
Is your mom okay?

553
00:30:58,041 --> 00:30:59,500
Yeah, she's fine.

554
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,208
She's, uh...

555
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:03,958
She's not very well at the moment.

556
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:10,083
Well, I had a very good time
with you tonight, Susan.

557
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:11,416
- Me too.

558
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:16,625
Have a good sleep,
and I'll see you in the morning.

559
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,791
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Chris.

560
00:31:40,875 --> 00:31:42,750
You okay for coffee?

561
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:46,083
Everything's good, Mom. Thanks. Very nice!

562
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:50,541
- Eggs aren't her strong suit.

563
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:53,333
It was so nice of her to cook for us.

564
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:56,083
- Oh!

565
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,666
I'm sorry, I really should go.

566
00:31:59,541 --> 00:32:02,583
- All right.
- Thank you.

567
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:05,333
All right, then? Both done?

568
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:11,500
Ooh! Oh, silly me.

569
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:13,958
- Are you going already, Susan?
- I-- I'm sorry.

570
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:17,333
I've had a lovely time.
Thank you for your hospitality.

571
00:32:17,416 --> 00:32:19,625
And you're walking her back.

572
00:32:19,708 --> 00:32:23,000
Lovely. Chivalry lives!

573
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:26,958
Separate rooms and everything. Christopher!

574
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:28,250
I know I embarrass you,

575
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:30,458
but I was right about the dating agency,

576
00:32:30,541 --> 00:32:32,208
wasn't I, hmm?

577
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:34,250
It was my idea.

578
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:37,833
Might even give it a go myself.

579
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:39,750
It's very nice to meet you.

580
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:43,541
You too, Susan. And hopefully...

581
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:45,708
we'll be seeing each other again.

582
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:03,000
Okay.

583
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:04,958
Look, maybe we should just say goodbye here.

584
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:06,583
Oh.

585
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:09,000
All right then. Goodbye.

586
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:15,666
- Bye.
- Bye.

587
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,416
- You've met my mother!

588
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,083
You're embarrassed of me, ain't you?

589
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,750
They're just old-fashioned! Maybe next time!

590
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:58,375
- Can you let me in?

591
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:01,541
- Mom?

592
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:03,041
Dad, please can-- can you let me in?

593
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,833
- I can explain.

594
00:35:58,125 --> 00:35:59,666
Sorry to keep you waiting, Susan.

595
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:02,000
I know it's been a long day already.

596
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:03,833
What we need now are your words

597
00:36:03,916 --> 00:36:06,125
on exactly what happened that night.

598
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:08,250
Chris can't really tell us, because...

599
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,375
uh, according to you both, he wasn't there.

600
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:12,041
Only you were there.

601
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:15,875
Now, you say that your mother shot your father.

602
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:18,458
That's not something
that happens every day, is it?

603
00:36:19,416 --> 00:36:21,875
So the obvious question is, "Why?"

604
00:36:21,958 --> 00:36:23,416
No comment.

605
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,750
Oh.

606
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:28,750
I thought you were feeling a bit
more comfortable talking to us.

607
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:32,166
What happened, Susan? Was there an argument

608
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,583
- or disagreement between them?
- No comment.

609
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:37,125
What did you feel when you saw your father there,

610
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:38,416
dead on the floor?

611
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:40,541
Your mother having shot him.

612
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:43,708
- I felt terrible.
- Terrible.

613
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:45,250
That's a normal reaction, I think, Susan.

614
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:46,750
What do you then do with that emotion?

615
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:48,791
- No comment.
- Do you confront your mother?

616
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:50,916
- No comment.
- What's she say to you?

617
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:52,541
These questions have to be answered, Susan.

618
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:53,958
They don't actually have to be answered, Susan.

619
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:55,958
- That's not strictly true.
- But this is a horrible event,

620
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:58,041
isn't it? Two people shot dead.

621
00:36:58,125 --> 00:37:00,041
- Your own parents.
- They're just-- This is what I mean by bait.

622
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:03,500
But it's not
a full explanation
to say you're simply provoked.

623
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:06,041
People are gonna provide
their own answers if you don't.

624
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:07,750
You don't have to say anything, Susan.

625
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:10,125
No comment.

626
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:13,500
The bank account you opened
the day after the killings,
Susan,

627
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:16,083
the pensions you collected,
the sale of the house,

628
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:17,541
all those debts you had to cover,

629
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:20,375
that feels like a slightly
better explanation, doesn't it,

630
00:37:20,458 --> 00:37:21,791
to someone who wasn't there?

631
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:23,791
That this really was all about money.

632
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:26,833
After all, you'd not seen
your parents for over a year

633
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:28,916
you say, and then suddenly you pay them a visit?

634
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,666
- And then they die.
- But it wasn't. As I said in my--

635
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,250
We've just been with your husband, Susan.

636
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,333
And do you know what word he used to describe

637
00:37:34,416 --> 00:37:36,541
your behavior? With that bank account?

638
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:39,250
"Mercenary."

639
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:41,916
And I'm sorry, but I'm inclined
to think a jury would agree.

640
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,666
He wouldn't say that.

641
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,500
Um-- I think it might be useful
for my client to--

642
00:37:45,583 --> 00:37:47,041
It's on tape, Susan.

643
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,333
Chris told us something else as well, Susan,

644
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:55,916
that I'd like to ask you about
if you're comfortable with it.

645
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,916
He said that your mother
told you something that night

646
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:00,750
that you didn't know.

647
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:03,750
What did your mother tell you that night?

648
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:07,625
She said, um...

649
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:10,666
She said, um...

650
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:21,291
Sorry. Must've been very hard
for him to tell you that.

651
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:23,000
Can I just-- I'm sorry...

652
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:24,750
- It's okay, sir. I'll explain.
-...I'd really like to remind--

653
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:26,375
I know how hard it is.

654
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:28,291
- But it'll be better for--
- I just said,

655
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:29,708
I'll explain it.

656
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:37,125
Even while I was sleeping,
I was aware of shouting,

657
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:38,708
some sort of row.

658
00:38:38,791 --> 00:38:42,083
But that was nothing unusual
in that household, not at all.

659
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:45,833
As I told you, I had been drinking a little.

660
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:47,375
A little more than normal. I don't--

661
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:48,833
I don't normally drink.

662
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:55,500
I don't know what time it is, maybe 2:00 a.m.,

663
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,333
and I've been woken by these bangs.

664
00:38:57,416 --> 00:38:59,416
- How many bangs?
- Uh...

665
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,000
I don't know, I was asleep.
Two maybe or-- or just one.

666
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:05,750
- Definitely not three.
- One or two?

667
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:07,416
Yes.

668
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,166
And I know immediately that my father's dead.

669
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,666
I don't know how I know, I just know.

670
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,583
And my mom is standing there with a gun,

671
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:15,166
and there are brass casings on the floor--

672
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,250
Brass casings?

673
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:18,375
Yeah, uh, spent bullets, I suppose.

674
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:20,375
And I can tell she's even more drunk

675
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:22,125
than she was when I want to bed.

676
00:39:22,208 --> 00:39:24,666
And then I say something like,
“What have you done?
You've killed him!”

677
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,208
Something like that, it was a long time ago.

678
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:28,291
And she says-- I can't give you the exact words,

679
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:32,708
- but she says something like...
- I had to!

680
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:36,250
I can't take it anymore, Susan!

681
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,375
- I couldn't look at him.
- Something along those lines.

682
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:41,500
And then she turns on me, and--
and she's actually waving
the gun at me at this point--

683
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:44,291
God knows why you care.

684
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:46,666
After everything you've been through,

685
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:48,916
grubby, little man.

686
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:51,958
Horrible, horrible man!

687
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:58,458
What a disgusting piece of work he was!

688
00:39:58,541 --> 00:39:59,791
And then she throws the gun on the bed

689
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:01,916
somewhere about here, so I pick it up.

690
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,083
He treated me

691
00:40:03,166 --> 00:40:05,041
as though he was disgusted with me!

692
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:06,375
- But really--
- Uh-- Sorry, Susan.

693
00:40:06,458 --> 00:40:09,041
- Yes?
- Why'd you pick up the gun?

694
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:11,083
Uh-- It's just-- Well,
she'd been waving it at me,

695
00:40:11,166 --> 00:40:13,708
and she was drunk, and I suppose I was afraid

696
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:15,583
that she was gonna pick it up again.

697
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:19,208
Um-- So, anyway, and then,
she starts saying that thing.

698
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,708
I hated him.

699
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:24,833
For years, I hated him.

700
00:40:26,916 --> 00:40:28,333
And I hate you too.

701
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,666
Because when I look at you, I know I failed.

702
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:39,458
I failed you, Susan, and I know that.

703
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:46,833
I know what he did to you.

704
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:52,208
I knew it, and I just let it happen.

705
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:55,750
How do you think I feel about that?

706
00:40:55,833 --> 00:41:00,125
- You knew, Mom? You knew?
- Look, of course I fucking knew!

707
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,958
I'm your mother, aren't I?

708
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:03,375
And he didn't even want me after that!

709
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:06,083
He couldn't do it. He couldn't even get it up!

710
00:41:06,166 --> 00:41:07,625
And I've spent the last fifteen years

711
00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:09,625
trying to forget what she said,
so I-- I can't tell you exactly,

712
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:11,000
but it was something like that.

713
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:12,833
Oh, I'm sorry.

714
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:17,958
I am so sorry, Susan.

715
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:21,833
I'm not a monster. I did my best.

716
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:24,875
We had some good times together,
though, didn't we?

717
00:41:24,958 --> 00:41:26,666
Even though you were a difficult child--

718
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,708
And all I could think of was
"I want to call my husband."

719
00:41:28,791 --> 00:41:30,541
I even said, "We should call Christopher,

720
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:31,666
he'd know what to do."

721
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:34,458
Give up, Susan!

722
00:41:34,541 --> 00:41:36,208
You think he's different, but he's not.

723
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:37,708
He's not gonna help you!

724
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:41,208
He's the same as all the others.
He's just using you for the sex!

725
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:43,125
- No, Mom!
- And then I keep crying

726
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:45,750
- and she keeps saying these--
- He doesn't love you!

727
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:48,666
Just accept it
before you get hurt!
Nobody loves you!

728
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:51,416
- Stop, please stop!
- God knows I tried!

729
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,875
But it's impossible. You're impossible to love!

730
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:55,125
Stop it, Mom! Stop it!

731
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:56,916
With your miserable little life.
It would've been better

732
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,583
for all of us if you'd
never ever been fucking born!

733
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:07,000
<i>I just want to confirm the implications</i>

734
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:08,208
of what you're saying.

735
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:09,916
Are you telling us that your father

736
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,666
abused you as a child?

737
00:42:13,833 --> 00:42:15,833
- Yes.
- Sexually?

738
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:18,125
Yes.

739
00:42:18,208 --> 00:42:19,708
And that was the night you first discovered

740
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:21,875
- that your mother had known all along?
- Yes.

741
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:23,416
And you'd never told her?

742
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,333
I was always too afraid
of what my father might do.

743
00:42:28,375 --> 00:42:29,541
I spent my whole life

744
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:31,416
just trying to wish it away.

745
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,125
Thinking of all those years after school

746
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:35,000
when she was at work and he...

747
00:42:36,208 --> 00:42:38,541
And Chris, your husband.

748
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:41,208
Are you sure he wasn't involved in the killings?

749
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:43,791
I only ask because the bullet holes

750
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:46,125
on your parents' chests were strikingly similar.

751
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:48,500
And that bank account, that looks like a plan.

752
00:42:49,916 --> 00:42:52,083
With all this new information today,

753
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:56,416
some of which is quite important
as my colleague is pointing out,

754
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,083
we will be applying for extra custody time,

755
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:00,583
- so we can continue.

756
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:02,208
So we're just trying to get everything

757
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:04,583
as clear as possible before we progress.

758
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:08,291
Uh-- I think she's been
pretty clear already, don't you?

759
00:43:11,416 --> 00:43:13,291
Are you sure Chris wasn't involved?

760
00:43:15,875 --> 00:43:17,458
He helped you, didn't he?

761
00:43:19,416 --> 00:43:20,833
He decided to protect you.

762
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,208
- Susan?

763
00:43:41,583 --> 00:43:43,958
Of course he did. He always protects me.

764
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,708
Did he bury the bodies for you?

765
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:51,000
Yes, he buried the bodies.

766
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:53,708
He's very practical like that.

767
00:43:53,791 --> 00:43:56,375
He has to be 'cause I'm not,
you see, so he has to be.

768
00:43:56,458 --> 00:43:58,166
Uh-- Susan, if you wanted a break...

769
00:43:58,250 --> 00:43:59,500
We couldn't tell the police.

770
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:01,708
He understood that, so he took control.

771
00:44:02,791 --> 00:44:04,583
And so...

772
00:44:04,666 --> 00:44:07,916
this was his idea, then? To bury the bodies?

773
00:44:08,916 --> 00:44:10,166
Yes, it was his idea.

774
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:13,250
He did that for me.

775
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:18,875
He's the only person in the world...

776
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,750
that's ever made me feel safe.

777
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:47,791
<i>We'll get it sorted.</i>

778
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:52,000
<i>He's not allowed to keep you</i>
<i>out of your own house.</i>

779
00:44:56,625 --> 00:44:58,125
Has he always been like that?

780
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,500
It's okay. You don't have to tell me.

781
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:08,208
No, I...

782
00:45:09,166 --> 00:45:10,416
I do want to tell you.

783
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:14,125
What is it?

784
00:45:19,208 --> 00:45:20,291
It's just, I've...

785
00:45:22,041 --> 00:45:23,500
I've never told anyone else.

786
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:29,291
Well...

787
00:45:30,291 --> 00:45:31,416
whatever it is...

788
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:34,625
it'll be between us.

789
00:45:35,958 --> 00:45:36,958
Just you...

790
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:39,208
and me.

791
00:46:10,583 --> 00:46:12,666
<i>Susan Edwards had been at her parents' house</i>

792
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:14,833
<i>when she was woken by a loud bang.</i>

793
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:18,291
<i>She'd gone into her parents' bedroom.</i>

794
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:20,791
<i>Her mother had shot her father.</i>

795
00:46:20,875 --> 00:46:24,125
<i>Susan Edwards</i>
<i>claimed an argument</i>
<i>then took place,</i>

796
00:46:24,208 --> 00:46:26,750
<i>during which her mother told her</i>
<i>she knew her father</i>

797
00:46:26,833 --> 00:46:28,791
<i>had abused her as a child.</i>

798
00:46:28,875 --> 00:46:31,541
<i>Now, Susan Edwards admits manslaughter.</i>

799
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:34,416
- <i>...manslaughter.</i>
- <i>...manslaughter.</i>

800
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,458
<i>She says killing her mother...</i>

801
00:46:36,541 --> 00:46:37,833
<i>...she was provoked...</i>

802
00:46:37,916 --> 00:46:38,958
- <i>...provoked...</i>
- <i>...provoked...</i>

803
00:46:39,041 --> 00:46:40,375
<i>...into shooting her.</i>

804
00:46:42,125 --> 00:46:44,958
<i>The Edwards</i>
<i>claimed they returned</i>
<i>to the house a week later</i>

805
00:46:45,041 --> 00:46:47,208
<i>and had sat down to eat fish and chips...</i>

806
00:46:47,291 --> 00:46:49,208
<i>...and watched the</i> Eurovision<i> song contest</i>

807
00:46:49,291 --> 00:46:50,541
<i>on television...</i>

808
00:46:50,625 --> 00:46:52,833
<i>...when Susan Edwards suddenly blurted out,</i>

809
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:54,375
<i>"They're upstairs."</i>

810
00:46:54,458 --> 00:46:56,208
<i>Christopher Edwards said he went upstairs</i>

811
00:46:56,291 --> 00:46:59,583
<i>to find the Wycherleys dead underneath the bed...</i>

812
00:46:59,666 --> 00:47:01,375
<i>...before then dragging the two dead bodies</i>

813
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:04,333
<i>down the stairs and burying them</i>
<i>here in the garden.</i>

814
00:47:04,416 --> 00:47:06,916
<i>But prosecutors say it was all a lie.</i>

815
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:09,666
<i>They claim the Edwards jointly planned</i>

816
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:11,333
<i>to kill the Wycherleys.</i>

817
00:47:11,416 --> 00:47:13,458
<i>Over the years, the Edwards emptied</i>

818
00:47:13,541 --> 00:47:15,291
<i>the elderly couple's bank accounts.</i>

819
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:17,541
<i>Both she and Christopher Edwards</i>

820
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:20,666
<i>admit burying the bodies and theft,</i>

821
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:23,291
<i>but both of them deny murder.</i>
