to help out a little.

This is your house, too.

201
00:15:59,562 --> 00:16:02,200
Okay, I'll stop doing homework
and grab a toolbelt.

202
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,141
Honey, sit down.

203
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:08,045
We want to talk to you
about something.

204
00:16:11,285 --> 00:16:15,494
About a year ago,
I found some pretty extreme porn

205
00:16:15,527 --> 00:16:17,765
‐on your computer.
‐We have to go through this
again?

206
00:16:17,798 --> 00:16:21,071
I told you guys I'm not looking
at that stuff anymore.

207
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:22,508
That is what you told us.

208
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:23,777
You gave us your word.

209
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,547
Which is why
it is so disappointing

210
00:16:25,581 --> 00:16:27,016
that you still are.

211
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,285
In fact, it looks like
you moved on

212
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:30,156
to even more disturbing
material.

213
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,561
I don't know what you guys
are talking about.

214
00:16:33,563 --> 00:16:37,070
We hired an IT guy to give us
the ability to look at

215
00:16:37,103 --> 00:16:39,040
all of the Internet searches
and sites

216
00:16:39,074 --> 00:16:40,611
visited on our home server.

217
00:16:40,644 --> 00:16:42,615
You've been spying on me?!

218
00:16:42,648 --> 00:16:44,117
‐You've been lying to us.
‐About what‐‐

219
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,554
what kind of porn
I like to look at?

220
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,423
What the fuck
am I supposed to do?

221
00:16:47,457 --> 00:16:50,296
‐It's none of your business.
‐Honey, you are 16 years old.

222
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:52,735
Okay, now, there's‐there's
nothing wrong

223
00:16:52,768 --> 00:16:56,509
with you expressing yourself
sexually with a little...

224
00:16:56,543 --> 00:16:58,312
pain or bondage.

225
00:16:58,345 --> 00:17:00,684
I mean, your dad and I
have done and seen it all.

226
00:17:00,717 --> 00:17:03,322
But these sites‐‐ the level of
physical pain and humiliation

227
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,393
that these girls are suffering‐‐

228
00:17:05,426 --> 00:17:08,299
it's just not good for
your young brain to see that.

229
00:17:08,332 --> 00:17:10,537
It's being wired right now,
Scarlett.

230
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,510
I mean, it's‐it's
gonna be hard for you

231
00:17:13,543 --> 00:17:16,315
to have normal sex
after seeing some of this stuff.

232
00:17:16,348 --> 00:17:18,452
I look at vanilla stuff,
too, sometimes.

233
00:17:18,485 --> 00:17:21,158
Mm‐mmm.
Hardly ever.

234
00:17:21,191 --> 00:17:22,695
(Michael sighs)

235
00:17:22,728 --> 00:17:25,333
Honey, can I ask you something?

236
00:17:25,366 --> 00:17:27,705
When you watch these things,

237
00:17:27,738 --> 00:17:30,611
do you fantasize about being
the masochist or the sadist?

238
00:17:30,644 --> 00:17:32,514
Okay, this is way too fucked‐up

239
00:17:32,548 --> 00:17:35,219
a conversation to have
with your parents, all right?

240
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:36,789
I'm sorry
I looked at that stuff

241
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:38,325
when I told you guys I wouldn't.
Bye.

242
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,096
Nope. No.
That is not good enough.

243
00:17:40,129 --> 00:17:43,168
Okay? We're gonna
want you to see a therapist.

244
00:17:43,202 --> 00:17:46,475
To find out what‐‐
why pain and shame turns me on?

245
00:17:46,509 --> 00:17:48,245
It turn every girl on.

246
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:49,615
Haven't you seen
Fifty Shades of Grey?

247
00:17:49,649 --> 00:17:52,186
No, this is not just
shame and pain.

248
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,659
‐It's violence.
‐We are putting a child lock
on the Internet

249
00:17:54,692 --> 00:17:57,463
and you are grounded
this weekend for lying to us.

250
00:17:57,498 --> 00:17:59,434
Wh‐What? No.
You can't.

251
00:17:59,467 --> 00:18:01,506
I‐I have a slumber party
to go to.

252
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,142
Whose?

253
00:18:03,175 --> 00:18:06,148
This girl Maya, who I like,
and her friends.

254
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,588
I'm sorry, okay?
I'll do whatever you want.

255
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,793
I'll go to therapy, just...

256
00:18:11,826 --> 00:18:13,563
please...

257
00:18:13,597 --> 00:18:15,399
don't take this from me.

258
00:18:17,538 --> 00:18:18,840
Fine.

259
00:18:18,873 --> 00:18:20,577
But you are seeing a therapist.

260
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:22,113
She'll be at the house tomorrow.

261
00:18:22,146 --> 00:18:23,750
Hey.

262
00:18:23,783 --> 00:18:25,353
No more lying.

263
00:18:25,386 --> 00:18:28,158
Honey, we're
understanding parents.

264
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:29,829
We're not uptight.

265
00:18:29,862 --> 00:18:31,799
I mean,
I got photos of Michael

266
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,737
at the Folsom Street Fair
from before you were born

267
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,206
that will prove that.

268
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,811
But there is a line
when sex stops

269
00:18:37,845 --> 00:18:40,617
and something very dark
and unhealthy starts.

270
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:42,554
Okay?

271
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,859
Okay.
(sniffles)

272
00:18:44,892 --> 00:18:47,498
I understand.

273
00:18:47,531 --> 00:18:48,767
Love you.

274
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,804
Hey, we love you, too,
sweetheart.

275
00:18:50,837 --> 00:18:53,175
Love you too.
Uh...

‐Yeah.
‐(door slams)

279
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,926
Okay.

280
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:03,530
TEACHER:
The largest part
of the human brain

281
00:19:03,563 --> 00:19:04,865
is the cerebrum,

282
00:19:04,899 --> 00:19:06,569
which is divided
into two hemispheres.

283
00:19:06,602 --> 00:19:09,274
And underneath lies
the brain stem,

284
00:19:09,307 --> 00:19:11,445
and behind that
sits the cerebellum.

285
00:19:11,478 --> 00:19:13,817
The outermost layer
of the cerebrum

286
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,419
‐is the cerebral cortex,
‐(phone vibrates)

287
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:18,325
which consists of four lobes‐‐
the frontal,

288
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:20,697
(echoing): parietal,
temporal and occipital.

289
00:19:20,731 --> 00:19:22,868
Like all vertebrae brains,

290
00:19:22,901 --> 00:19:25,741
the human brain develops
from three sections

291
00:19:25,774 --> 00:19:28,880
known as the forebrain,
midbrain and hindbrain.

I found it in the house.

312
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,975
I threw it away,

313

put it back in my closet.

00:22:40,931 --> 00:22:42,701
And go take a very hot shower.

00:22:42,734 --> 00:22:44,905
‐I don't ever want to see
that again.
‐No, I'm keeping it.

Oh, my God.
Absolutely not.

322
00:22:46,776 --> 00:22:48,613
God, you guys think you can
control every part of me.

323
00:22:48,646 --> 00:22:50,984
Well, guess what‐‐
it is my body and my mind,

324
00:22:51,017 --> 00:22:53,155
‐and you can't control it.
‐Yeah? Okay, fine.

325
00:22:53,188 --> 00:22:54,758
‐Then I'm gonna tear it off you

‐Fuck.
‐Okay, here, babe.

329
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,741
You think you need stitches?

330
00:23:02,774 --> 00:23:06,616
‐I do. Fuck.
‐Okay, okay.
Let's get you dressed, okay?

331
00:23:06,649 --> 00:23:08,820
‐I think there's
an urgent care nearby.
‐Let me come with you.

00:23:08,853 --> 00:23:10,456
No.
Just go to your room.

333
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:11,759
You can come out to throw away

334
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:13,496
that awful costume,
but that is it.

335
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:14,899
And please be aware, young lady,

336
00:23:14,932 --> 00:23:17,470
I will not be talking to you
for weeks.

337
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,009
(quietly):
Just let me...

338
00:23:39,147 --> 00:23:42,053
found that only 17%
of young women under 18

339
00:23:42,086 --> 00:23:44,057
watched porn
for sexual excitement.

340
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,696
and only 0.3 of them
watched violent porn.

341
00:23:46,729 --> 00:23:48,833
So you're saying I'm a freak.

342
00:23:48,866 --> 00:23:50,770
I'm saying that when someone's
behavior is atypical,

343
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,774
it's worth exploring
the reasons why.

344
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:54,878
Scarlett, you're not a freak.

345
00:23:54,912 --> 00:23:57,651
You're not weird
or defective in any way.

346
00:23:57,684 --> 00:23:59,655
What turns you on
turns you on.

347
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,559
The only reason why
we have to get into this

348
00:24:01,592 --> 00:24:04,030
is because last night
you acted out in a violent way.

349
00:24:04,063 --> 00:24:06,468
That was an accident.
I never would have hurt my dads.

350
00:24:06,502 --> 00:24:08,573
Honey, then why
scare us like that?

351
00:24:08,606 --> 00:24:10,710
I don't know, 'cause I thought
it was funny or something.

352
00:24:10,744 --> 00:24:12,948
We prank each other
all the time, don't we?

353
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,787
Uh, she's not wrong about that.
We do.

354
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,493
I mean, one time
we challenged Troy

355
00:24:18,526 --> 00:24:19,795
to a water balloon fight

356
00:24:19,828 --> 00:24:21,699
but we filled
our balloons with paint.

357
00:24:21,732 --> 00:24:22,934
Yeah, and one time I changed

358
00:24:22,968 --> 00:24:24,938
Michael's iPhone language
to Chinese.

359
00:24:24,972 --> 00:24:26,976
He had to take it to
the Apple Store to get it fixed.

360
00:24:28,011 --> 00:24:29,581
So you think
dressing up in a costume

361
00:24:29,615 --> 00:24:31,585
and threatening your dads
with a knife

362
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:33,088
is in the same ballpark
of fun and games

363
00:24:33,121 --> 00:24:35,760
as changing a language
on an iPhone?

364
00:24:36,762 --> 00:24:38,098
Uh, we tend to be

365
00:24:38,131 --> 00:24:40,002
a little overprotective. Um...

366
00:24:42,006 --> 00:24:44,143
When Scarlett was three,
she was kidnapped.

367
00:24:45,647 --> 00:24:47,116
I was, uh, at the market.

368
00:24:47,149 --> 00:24:48,553
And I...

369
00:24:48,586 --> 00:24:50,724
I put her
in her car seat first.

370
00:24:52,193 --> 00:24:53,963
And then I went around back

371
00:24:53,997 --> 00:24:55,967
to put the groceries
in the trunk.

372
00:24:56,001 --> 00:24:58,138
(grunts)

373
00:25:00,142 --> 00:25:02,614
(groans)

374
00:25:02,647 --> 00:25:04,083
(engine starts)

375
00:25:04,117 --> 00:25:05,887
While I was back there,
someone stole the car

376
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,223
with Scarlett in it.

377
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,526
What are you doing?

378
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,162
No, that's my daughter!

379
00:25:10,195 --> 00:25:13,569
No! No!

380
00:25:13,603 --> 00:25:15,573
Scarlett!

381
00:25:15,607 --> 00:25:18,613
‐That's terrible.
‐Yeah, she was missing
for ten days.

382
00:25:18,646 --> 00:25:22,253
They found the car right away,
but no sign of Scarlett.

383
00:25:22,286 --> 00:25:24,558
‐It was all over the news.
‐TROY: Mm‐hmm.

384
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:27,129
Finally, a pediatrician's office
called the police.

385
00:25:27,163 --> 00:25:29,535
This woman had brought
a three‐year‐old girl in

386
00:25:29,568 --> 00:25:31,739
for a checkup
without any information

387
00:25:31,772 --> 00:25:33,810
about her "daughter's"
medical history.

388
00:25:33,843 --> 00:25:36,782
Turns out that this woman
had just lost her own daughter.

389
00:25:36,816 --> 00:25:39,320
Her ex‐husband
had murdered the child.

390
00:25:39,353 --> 00:25:41,224
I guess it just
drove the poor woman mad.

391
00:25:41,257 --> 00:25:43,095
She went looking
for a replacement.

392
00:25:44,865 --> 00:25:47,704
Scarlett, do you remember
anything about those ten days?

393
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:51,077
Not really.

394
00:25:51,111 --> 00:25:53,850
I mean, I don't even
remember being scared

395
00:25:53,883 --> 00:25:56,287
or anyone trying to hurt me
or anything.

396
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,826
She didn't have
a scratch on her.

397
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,231
I mean, we're the ones who were
the most traumatized by it.

398
00:26:02,901 --> 00:26:04,938
But then, when we saw
the porn sites

399
00:26:04,972 --> 00:26:07,744
and the suit we got worried

400
00:26:07,778 --> 00:26:11,719
that maybe
she had been affected.

401
00:26:13,288 --> 00:26:16,027
Maybe.

402
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,165
What I'm most worried about
is this house.

403
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,237
Scarlett, you've heard
all the stories

404
00:26:21,271 --> 00:26:22,941
about what happened here, right?

405
00:26:22,974 --> 00:26:25,847
Yeah. Like Amityville Horror
on crystal meth.

406
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,951
Do you think
it's been challenging,

407
00:26:27,984 --> 00:26:29,320
emotionally, moving in here?

408
00:26:29,353 --> 00:26:30,957
I'm sorry, we don't believe

409
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,359
‐in haunted houses.
‐(chuckles)

410
00:26:32,393 --> 00:26:34,063
Seriously, why would
a spirit stick around

411
00:26:34,097 --> 00:26:36,301
on Earth when it has
the whole universe to explore?

412
00:26:36,334 --> 00:26:38,105
The stories are absurd.

413
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,875
We believe in science
in this family.

414
00:26:39,908 --> 00:26:42,814
(chuckles) I don't believe
in haunted houses, either.

415
00:26:42,848 --> 00:26:46,054
But I do believe that knowing
what dark things have occurred

416
00:26:46,087 --> 00:26:49,928
in a place can create a darkness
in someone's psyche.

417
00:26:49,962 --> 00:26:53,235
It's the reason
why cemeteries feel scary

418
00:26:53,268 --> 00:26:57,042
or old dungeons
or "haunted" houses.

419
00:26:58,178 --> 00:27:00,115
If we know what terrible things

420
00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:01,685
have happened in a place,

421
00:27:01,719 --> 00:27:03,221
then we are forced
to confront the truth

422
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:05,727
that terrible things
can happen at all.

423
00:27:07,263 --> 00:27:08,766
I mean,
it's impossible not to get

424
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,837
a little dark,
a little depressed.

425
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,208
It affects all of us.

426
00:27:13,241 --> 00:27:15,245
I‐I felt it myself
when I came in here.

427
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,749
A heaviness in the air.

428
00:27:16,782 --> 00:27:18,418
See?
It's all your fault.

429
00:27:18,451 --> 00:27:20,355
I didn't say that.

430
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,259
I'm sorry, we have to end.

431
00:27:22,293 --> 00:27:23,963
‐(pen clicks)
‐But we're not‐we're not done.

432
00:27:23,996 --> 00:27:25,733
Can we pay you for another hour?

433
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:27,369
I have another client
all the way over in Brentwood.

434
00:27:27,403 --> 00:27:29,842
‐But I would like to see
all of you next week.
‐MICHAEL: Yes.

435
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:32,948
‐And Scarlett alone
later this week.
‐MICHAEL: Great.

436
00:27:32,981 --> 00:27:35,820
You can set all that up
with my office.

437
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:37,757
‐Would you mind if I used
the restroom before I go?
‐No.

438
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:39,862
Oh, sure, it's the third door
down that hall.

439
00:27:39,895 --> 00:27:42,099
Thank you.
I'll see myself out.

440
00:27:44,003 --> 00:27:45,673
Definitely no slumber party
tonight, though.

441
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:47,409
What? No.

442
00:27:47,443 --> 00:27:49,347
Hey, your father has
six stitches in his arm.

443
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,752
I'm sorry, you'll have to see
this girl next weekend.

444
00:27:51,785 --> 00:27:53,823
Fuck you! Fuck both of you!
You heard her.

445
00:27:53,856 --> 00:27:57,797
This is all because you moved us
into this stupid fucking house.

446
00:27:57,831 --> 00:28:00,369
I wish that kidnapper
would have kept me!

447
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:04,443
‐(sighs) So do we.
‐Michael.

448
00:28:04,477 --> 00:28:06,414
Sorry.
Sorry, I went dark.

449
00:28:06,447 --> 00:28:08,819
‐That's not helpful.
‐Sorry, honey.

450
00:28:14,063 --> 00:28:16,034
(creaking)

451
00:28:26,889 --> 00:28:28,793
Scarlett?

452
00:28:30,964 --> 00:28:33,235
Is anyone there?

453
00:28:33,268 --> 00:28:34,838
‐(wood snaps)
‐(giggling)

454
00:28:37,877 --> 00:28:39,915
ANDI:
Hello?

455
00:28:49,835 --> 00:28:51,839
BOY (echoes):
You are going to die in there.

456
00:29:06,467 --> 00:29:08,204
(muttering softly)

457
00:29:13,014 --> 00:29:14,818
(exhales)

458
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:24,003
(quietly):
The fuck?

459
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,375
‐Whose blood was that?
‐I don't know.

460
00:29:43,408 --> 00:29:45,880
Hers, maybe?
Time of the month?

461
00:29:45,913 --> 00:29:47,984
Oh, right.

462
00:29:48,018 --> 00:29:50,890
It would also explain
how bitchy she's been.

463
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:54,531
You want to get blitzed on Xanax
and edibles and watch The Crown?

464
00:29:54,564 --> 00:29:57,436

MAYA:
We drink booze that doesn't

496
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,512
we smoke without inhaling
any smoke.

497

that everything about us

498

is, like, totally fake?

who isn't fake.

You say what you want even if
people make fun of you for it,

and you don't, like, conform
to the superficial standards

that everybody else does.

Nicole.
She's not officially out.

512

No, it's okay.

513
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,626
I don't know. I mean...

514
00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:41,598
I'm sure it helps to not have
to try to impress some dude

515
00:32:41,632 --> 00:32:44,003
that only cares about
how a girl looks.

516
00:32:44,036 --> 00:32:46,274
And I'm not
not out, I just don't need

517
00:32:46,307 --> 00:32:48,546
everybody at school
to fetishizing my sex life.

or the one being tortured?

704
00:46:06,306 --> 00:46:07,442
It's the former.

705
00:46:09,212 --> 00:46:12,151
Okay, sweetheart.

706
00:46:12,185 --> 00:46:13,755
Thanks for telling us.

707
00:46:15,525 --> 00:46:17,796
Get you some breakfast.

708
00:46:25,612 --> 00:46:29,052
I really think we should
have a session about this.

709
00:46:29,085 --> 00:46:30,956
I got some time
between 4:00 and 6:00.

710
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:32,258
There's another therapist here,

711
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:33,528
so I'm just fighting
for office hours.

712
00:46:33,561 --> 00:46:35,064
I'm good, thanks.

713
00:46:35,097 --> 00:46:37,101
You just murdered four girls.

714
00:46:37,135 --> 00:46:39,372
We need to talk about
your feelings about this.

715
00:46:39,406 --> 00:46:42,478
Why? I've never
felt better in my life.
