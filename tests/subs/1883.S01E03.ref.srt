1
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:22,674
- Come on.

2
00:00:22,761 --> 00:00:24,024
- Easy, boy. Easy.

3
00:00:40,475 --> 00:00:42,825
- Hey, don't push from there, get to the back!

4
00:00:42,912 --> 00:00:44,479
Get to the back!

5
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,411
<i>Death is everywhere on the prairie.</i>

6
00:01:03,498 --> 00:01:06,805
<i>In every form you can imagine.</i>

7
00:01:06,892 --> 00:01:10,679
<i>And a few your worst nightmare couldn't muster...</i>

8
00:01:25,389 --> 00:01:27,348
<i>Death hides in the creek beds...</i>

9
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:39,186
<i>possesses animals...</i>

10
00:01:42,058 --> 00:01:43,929
<i>It hides in tall grass, waiting...</i>

11
00:01:45,322 --> 00:01:47,194
- Ow!

12
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:13,176
- <i>With every death,</i>

13
00:02:13,263 --> 00:02:16,092
<i>our father moved camp a little farther away.</i>

14
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:19,748
<i>As if death was not the result
of accidents and disease,</i>

15
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:22,098
<i>but death was its own disease.</i>

16
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:24,927
<i>And carelessness was contagious.</i>

17
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:44,686
<i>But of all the perils awaiting us,</i>

18
00:02:44,773 --> 00:02:49,343
<i>sickness and snakes, bad horses and bandits,</i>

19
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,736
<i>there was one thing above all that sent terror</i>

20
00:02:51,823 --> 00:02:54,130
<i>through both man and beast.</i>

21
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:56,785
<i>There was one word so feared it was never spoken.</i>

22
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,179
<i>And barely whispered...</i>

23
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,270
<i>River.</i>

24
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:36,014
You're not moving a wagon across that.

25
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:39,627
- We'll take them east. Use the ferry in Denison.

26
00:04:39,714 --> 00:04:41,716
- Denison's the wrong direction.

27
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:44,632
We gotta head west somewhere,
may as well be here.

28
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:47,330
- West Texas is rough.

29
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:48,375
- It's all rough.

30
00:04:50,377 --> 00:04:53,075
- How far west we gotta go
to get a better crossing?

31
00:04:53,162 --> 00:04:56,557
- You're going a ways.

32
00:04:56,644 --> 00:04:59,734
Hundred miles or more.

33
00:04:59,821 --> 00:05:01,692
And where it runs shallow it's boggy.

34
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:03,651
Real boggy.

35
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:05,566
- We'll head east. Use the ferry.

36
00:05:05,653 --> 00:05:08,482
- You do what you want. I'm heading west.

37
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:10,005
- I said east.

38
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:11,311
- I don't give a shit what you said.

39
00:05:11,398 --> 00:05:13,138
I don't work for you.

40
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:15,227
- They won't make it. The country's too rough.

41
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,621
No water.

42
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,536
There's bandits in every canyon,

43
00:05:19,623 --> 00:05:21,756
and there ain't no wall around
that reservation, neither.

44
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,456
- I ain't asking your permission,

45
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:28,415
I'm telling you my decision.

46
00:05:28,502 --> 00:05:30,068
And my decision's west.

47
00:05:40,644 --> 00:05:42,646
- Denison puts us two weeks behind.

48
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:45,170
- I'll worry about winter when it comes.

49
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:47,303
I'll drown them if we cross here

50
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,436
and they'll die of thirst if we head west.

51
00:05:49,523 --> 00:05:52,613
- They're dying pretty good as it is, Captain.

52
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,398
And we ain't even left Texas yet.

53
00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:58,227
We need to keep winter in
our minds, 'cause it's coming...

54
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:03,363
I don't know where to cross 'em,

55
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,583
but I ain't here and I know it ain't east.

56
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,543
- If we head west we're crossing the Brazos.

57
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,109
- Ain't no good options, Captain.

58
00:06:11,196 --> 00:06:15,070
Just know that winter is the worst option.

59
00:06:15,157 --> 00:06:17,899
And slow as these folks move,

60
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:20,075
we're biting off a decent chunk of it already.

61
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:44,491
- We gonna cross here?

62
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:46,406
- To the West.

63
00:06:48,016 --> 00:06:50,235
- West, where?

64
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:52,150
- I don't know yet.

65
00:06:59,897 --> 00:07:02,378
- Cowboys are headed back to their camp.

66
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:03,945
Need a few boys to help hold the herd.

67
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:05,076
- Well, pick some.

68
00:07:05,163 --> 00:07:06,687
- Been tryin'.

69
00:07:06,774 --> 00:07:07,731
Most of 'em they don't speak English

70
00:07:07,818 --> 00:07:10,473
and the ones that do say they can't ride.

71
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,822
- Well, they gotta learn some time.

72
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:13,607
- I don't disagree.

73
00:07:13,694 --> 00:07:15,870
Just not sure keeping our food
from running off is the time.

74
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,655
Sure could use y'all.

75
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,094
- I can saddle Lightning.

76
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,794
- You ain't going by yourself.

77
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:28,273
- You're coming.

78
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,319
- No, I'm hunting. We need meat.

79
00:07:30,406 --> 00:07:32,452
- I'll catch Poco too.

80
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:33,844
Take care of your son.

81
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:35,716
- You're gonna ride herd?

82
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:38,109
- Tired of getting my teeth
rattled by this wagon.

83
00:07:38,196 --> 00:07:39,937
My choice is to sit on that log,

84
00:07:40,024 --> 00:07:42,897
sit in a saddle, I'm gonna sit in a saddle.

85
00:07:42,984 --> 00:07:44,812
- How am I supposed to sneak up on something

86
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:46,161
with a five year-old?

87
00:07:46,248 --> 00:07:49,164
- Teach him to be quiet or find a dumb deer.

88
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:51,906
- I can be quiet.

89
00:07:51,993 --> 00:07:53,560
- Well, I guess we're about
to find out, ain't we?

90
00:07:58,086 --> 00:07:58,913
Shit.

91
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:09,837
- It's better to double the latigo with him.

92
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:12,579
- Girl... I've forgotten more about horses

93
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:13,841
than you'll ever know.

94
00:08:22,023 --> 00:08:23,807
- Ready?

95
00:08:23,894 --> 00:08:25,505
Let's get after it.

96
00:08:45,786 --> 00:08:48,963
- Ain't much of a team player.

97
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,704
- Yeah, but he's capable.

98
00:08:52,749 --> 00:08:55,622
- I don't like him questioning us.

99
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:57,232
- Not much we can do about it.

100
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:59,103
He ain't on the payroll.

101
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,845
- Yeah.

102
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:07,329
When there's two leaders there ain't no leader.

103
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,635
Know what I'm mean?

104
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:11,115
Need to figure that out.

105
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:31,527
- She the one whose husband got run over?

106
00:09:31,614 --> 00:09:33,703
- Bandits killed her husband.

107
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:44,409
- These damn horses...

108
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:45,367
- They're just thirsty.

109
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:50,372
- Before you do anything else,
you tend to your horses.

110
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,243
- I'll take 'em to drink.

111
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,681
Then I'll show you how to hobble
'em so they don't run off...

112
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:57,074
- You need a fire.

113
00:09:57,161 --> 00:09:59,511
- It's too hot for fire.

114
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,861
- Fire ain't just for warmth.

115
00:10:00,948 --> 00:10:04,516
Keeps bugs away. Snakes won't go near it.

116
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,389
And from way up there...

117
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:08,477
You can see 'em.

118
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:10,218
The more fires folks see,

119
00:10:10,305 --> 00:10:11,523
the less chance they come to our camp

120
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,526
seeing what else they can find.

121
00:10:18,487 --> 00:10:19,880
When's the last time they drank?

122
00:10:21,229 --> 00:10:22,883
- I don't know.

123
00:10:50,432 --> 00:10:51,868
- You got any other family here?

124
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:57,178
- You are married?

125
00:10:57,265 --> 00:10:58,875
- No.

126
00:10:58,962 --> 00:11:00,660
- I can be a wife for you.

127
00:11:00,747 --> 00:11:03,097
- I don't want a wife.

128
00:11:03,184 --> 00:11:07,667
- My boys are good boys and I can be a good wife.

129
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:11,235
I can be a good wife.
- Stop.

130
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:12,323
- Please don't go.
- Quit.

131
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,981
I don't want a wife.

132
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:21,419
I'll help you.

133
00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:22,943
I'll help you with your horses.

134
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,335
I can help you set your camp.

135
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:25,946
With your boys...

136
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:30,167
I had a wife, and I ain't
looking for another one.

137
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:31,865
You understand?

138
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:37,218
I will get you to Oregon.

139
00:11:37,305 --> 00:11:38,828
You have my word.

140
00:11:38,915 --> 00:11:40,656
- Then what?

141
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:42,179
What in Oregon is for me?

142
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:44,834
- I don't know. Maybe you find a husband there.

143
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:47,141
Maybe you farm the land yourself.

144
00:11:47,228 --> 00:11:50,622
I don't know...
- I don't know to farm.

145
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,059
I don't know.
- Maybe you learn.

146
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:55,758
- Maybe you teach me. Maybe you teach me.

147
00:11:55,845 --> 00:11:58,239
- I won't be there to teach you.

148
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:51,596
- What happened to her?

149
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:53,076
- She wants to marry me.

150
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:54,382
- Guessing you said no.

151
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,562
Or you said yes and she already regrets it.

152
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:02,172
- No time for jokes, Thomas.

153
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:03,913
She's having a hard time of it.

154
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,959
- Hard times is the only kind out here, Captain.

155
00:13:07,874 --> 00:13:10,615
Laughing through 'em is how you get through 'em.

156
00:13:10,702 --> 00:13:12,704
And I ain't joking,

157
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,316
she's lucky as hell she ain't
marrying your sour ass.

158
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:18,623
See how I did that?

159
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,626
A joke on top of a joke.

160
00:13:21,713 --> 00:13:23,977
- Yeah. Real funny.

161
00:13:28,372 --> 00:13:30,461
- Ma'am.

162
00:13:30,548 --> 00:13:32,899
Let me show you how to hobble these horses.

163
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:42,734
See, now they can still walk to water,

164
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,041
they just can't run off on you.

165
00:13:45,128 --> 00:13:47,174
Just place 'em around like this,

166
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:48,740
in a figure eight.

167
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,702
You know, figure eight?

168
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:55,530
You know what I mean?

169
00:13:57,619 --> 00:13:59,447
You try this one.

170
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:26,822
What's your name?

171
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:29,694
- Noemi.

172
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,788
- When you get to Portland,

173
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:40,096
some handsome farmer's gonna spot you in town,

174
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:42,664
and take one look in them big eyes you got

175
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:43,926
and he's gonna chase you down the street

176
00:14:44,013 --> 00:14:45,972
with flowers and candy.

177
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:47,538
You watch.

178
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:54,371
Don't want to be marrying out of fear.

179
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,157
You'll get by out here just fine.

180
00:14:57,244 --> 00:14:58,898
We'll get you by.

181
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:02,684
Then... let a man earn your love...

182
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:06,514
...instead of you trading him for it.

183
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:11,432
And trust me, that crusty bastard over there?

184
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,218
Happiness runs from him like a scalded dog.

185
00:15:15,305 --> 00:15:17,525
No, ma'am, you don't want no part of the Captain.

186
00:15:18,874 --> 00:15:20,049
No part of the Captain.

187
00:15:30,016 --> 00:15:31,191
- What have you got for food?

188
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:36,283
You don't have any supplies?

189
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,719
- They took them.

190
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:39,068
- Who took them?

191
00:16:00,872 --> 00:16:02,004
- What the fuck for that?

192
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:03,875
- This is what the fuck.

193
00:16:08,924 --> 00:16:11,100
- Get everything that was hers.

194
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:13,407
- Nothing was hers, it was his,
and he's a thief--

195
00:16:14,712 --> 00:16:16,845
- Get everything that was hers.

196
00:16:16,932 --> 00:16:18,412
- They're gypsies! Everything--

197
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:28,596
- When I speak and you don't
do what I say, you get hurt.

198
00:16:28,683 --> 00:16:30,815
That's the pattern here

199
00:16:30,902 --> 00:16:33,905
and it don't stop until you do what I say

200
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,342
or you run out of face.

201
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,656
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

202
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:53,229
- How can we travel?
- You can't. Not with me.

203
00:16:53,316 --> 00:16:57,581
If you steal, you will stay where you stole.

204
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:10,899
Ya, go on! Ya, ya, ya, ya!

205
00:17:10,986 --> 00:17:13,206
Ya!

206
00:17:21,562 --> 00:17:23,868
Go east. Go south.

207
00:17:23,955 --> 00:17:26,610
Go any way but my way.

208
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:28,438
If I see you again, I'm gonna kill you.

209
00:17:40,972 --> 00:17:42,974
I thought you were in charge.

210
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,411
- I am in charge.

211
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:46,935
- Then act like it. Police your people.

212
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:48,589
- These are not my people.

213
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:50,417
I don't control them. No one does.

214
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:52,549
- If you don't control them
then you aren't in charge.

215
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:55,596
I will find someone else.

216
00:17:55,683 --> 00:17:58,033
- You don't decide these things.

217
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,165
This is a free country.

218
00:17:59,252 --> 00:18:01,254
- That's a free country.

219
00:18:01,341 --> 00:18:03,386
That is Comanche land.

220
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:06,215
Beyond it is no man's land
and that's where we're going...

221
00:18:06,302 --> 00:18:07,956
You ain't free yet.

222
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:14,615
- You all right?

223
00:18:14,702 --> 00:18:16,051
- Peachy.

224
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:19,010
- That wasn't very peachy.

225
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,883
Captain...

226
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:22,971
Shea.

227
00:18:25,408 --> 00:18:28,281
These folks here gots to trust us.

228
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:31,197
If they don't trust us they won't follow us--

229
00:18:31,284 --> 00:18:32,328
- Trust us?

230
00:18:32,415 --> 00:18:35,331
They can't even trust each other.

231
00:18:35,418 --> 00:18:37,246
- It's a bad way to start the trip.

232
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,421
- The trip's already started,

233
00:18:38,508 --> 00:18:41,250
and it's been bad from the beginning.

234
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:43,034
- You having second thoughts?

235
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,123
- You're gonna tell me you ain't?

236
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,907
- Yeah, I'm having 'em...

237
00:18:45,994 --> 00:18:48,736
But...

238
00:18:48,823 --> 00:18:51,347
I figure maybe if...

239
00:18:51,434 --> 00:18:53,610
one of their kids has a kid

240
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:58,354
and that kid does something...

241
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:01,357
something that...

242
00:19:01,444 --> 00:19:05,927
The world's better 'cause that kid's in it.

243
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:07,537
Know what I mean?

244
00:19:07,624 --> 00:19:10,540
- World ain't getting better, Thomas.

245
00:19:10,627 --> 00:19:12,325
No matter how many kids are in it.

246
00:19:22,639 --> 00:19:24,598
- Woo.

247
00:19:24,685 --> 00:19:26,513
One for me. One for you.

248
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,558
- Think that one's taken.

249
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:30,908
And her husband don't look too fun to fight.

250
00:19:30,995 --> 00:19:33,563
I'd keep that in mind when
you're chasing his daughter.

251
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,523
- Well, good looks run in the family, I see.

252
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,307
- Good manners don't seem to run in yours.

253
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:41,136
We should push these cattle to water,

254
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:42,268
then hold 'em tight for the night.

255
00:19:42,355 --> 00:19:43,834
- That's the plan.

256
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:45,053
Just waiting on the cowboys to do it.

257
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,186
- Then you are all out of excuses.

258
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:56,064
- Guess this outfit's got a
new cow boss and it ain't us.

259
00:19:56,151 --> 00:19:58,066
- She could boss the President.

260
00:19:58,153 --> 00:20:00,242
- Hm. The President could probably use it.

261
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:05,900
- Nothing sharp to say today?

262
00:20:05,987 --> 00:20:08,772
- I used my one snappy line
and it got snapped back at me.

263
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:11,427
- Hm. That's all it takes to rattle you?

264
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:16,998
- My gosh, you're forward.

265
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:18,826
- Look who's blushing now.

266
00:20:18,913 --> 00:20:21,350
- Are you saying I made you blush?

267
00:20:21,437 --> 00:20:25,049
- Maybe you made me blush.

268
00:20:25,136 --> 00:20:28,009
- Well, you have terrible taste in men.

269
00:20:30,446 --> 00:20:32,666
You ain't a man.

270
00:20:32,753 --> 00:20:33,667
You're just a boy.

271
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:37,410
- I'm man enough.

272
00:20:39,455 --> 00:20:42,023
- Just a boy.

273
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,243
Guess I have terrible taste in boys, too.

274
00:20:49,552 --> 00:20:50,814
You know, this flirting thing is fun!

275
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:58,779
- So... She was...she was flirtin'.

276
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:01,608
Kinda mean the way she does it,
but she is flirtin'.

277
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:02,522
Woo-hoo!

278
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:12,140
- Am I being quiet?

279
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:14,838
- Well, you were being quiet. Now you're talking.

280
00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:16,362
- Sorry.

281
00:21:16,449 --> 00:21:18,059
- It's okay.

282
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:19,278
- Do you see anything?

283
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:22,324
- Shhh.

284
00:21:22,411 --> 00:21:23,891
- Can we whisper?

285
00:21:23,978 --> 00:21:26,981
- We can't talk at all 'cause they'll hear us.

286
00:21:27,068 --> 00:21:28,983
- They can't hear the horse?

287
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,594
- They can hear the horse.
They're just not scared of it.

288
00:21:31,681 --> 00:21:33,596
- How come?

289
00:21:33,683 --> 00:21:36,425
- Well, 'cause horses don't shoot deer.

290
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:39,472
- But we're on the horse and we shoot deer.

291
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:41,778
- Well, that's why we gotta be quiet.

292
00:21:41,865 --> 00:21:44,041
- But can't deer see us on the horse?

293
00:21:44,128 --> 00:21:47,523
- They can see us on the horse,
they just don't understand it.

294
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:51,005
- They don't understand we're sitting on a horse?

295
00:21:51,092 --> 00:21:54,574
- They don't understand
why we're siting on a horse.

296
00:21:54,661 --> 00:21:57,141
- If they understood
why we're sitting on a horse,

297
00:21:57,228 --> 00:21:59,492
they would head for the hills.

298
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:03,496
'Course, we're in the hills so
that wouldn't do 'em much good.

299
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:06,847
- Dammit, John. Be quiet.

300
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,765
Sshh! Goddammit. Son...

301
00:22:11,852 --> 00:22:13,244
Shh...

302
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,637
There's a... Look, deer.

303
00:22:14,724 --> 00:22:16,813
Deer.
- I see it.

304
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,902
- All right.

305
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:20,469
Shh.

306
00:22:32,829 --> 00:22:34,353
Lay down right beside me.

307
00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:38,618
Lean in here.

308
00:22:40,054 --> 00:22:41,142
You see him?

309
00:22:41,229 --> 00:22:42,361
- Yes, sir.

310
00:22:42,448 --> 00:22:43,449
- All right.

311
00:22:45,581 --> 00:22:47,148
Put your finger beside the trigger.

312
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:49,106
Not on it. Till I tell you.

313
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,720
- Is it going to kick?

314
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:58,638
- It's gonna kick. And it's gonna hurt.

315
00:22:58,725 --> 00:23:00,204
But you won't remember the kick in a week.

316
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:01,249
All you'll remember is the kill.

317
00:23:01,336 --> 00:23:03,294
Look through there.

318
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,819
Put the cross hairs right behind his shoulder.

319
00:23:05,906 --> 00:23:06,820
- Yes, sir.

320
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:07,821
- Is it there?

321
00:23:07,908 --> 00:23:09,388
- Yes, sir.

322
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:10,911
- Put your finger on the trigger.

323
00:23:10,998 --> 00:23:12,608
Pull slowly.

324
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,225
You got him.

325
00:23:21,312 --> 00:23:23,532
- I got him?

326
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:25,142
- You got him, son.

327
00:23:32,193 --> 00:23:33,629
Let's go get him.

328
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:50,429
Watch your step, son.

329
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:00,308
- He's huge.

330
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:02,049
- Yes, sir, he is.

331
00:24:02,136 --> 00:24:03,442
He'll feed us for a week.

332
00:24:05,574 --> 00:24:06,662
Now, come here.

333
00:24:11,754 --> 00:24:13,452
It's your first kill, so I gotta blood you.

334
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,631
There we go.

335
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:25,028
You took a life to give us life.

336
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,683
So now we say thank you.

337
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,903
- To who?

338
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,470
- To the deer.

339
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:35,343
- But the deer's dead. He can't hear us.

340
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,301
- Well, we say thank you anyway.

341
00:24:37,388 --> 00:24:39,390
- How do we say thank you?

342
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,131
- We just say it.

343
00:24:43,177 --> 00:24:44,526
- Thank you.

344
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:52,795
- When you kill a thing, son,

345
00:24:52,882 --> 00:24:55,015
it makes you a little less man,

346
00:24:55,102 --> 00:24:57,844
a little more animal.

347
00:24:57,931 --> 00:25:00,803
Now we try to find the balance between them.

348
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:03,240
That's all life is.

349
00:25:03,327 --> 00:25:04,720
You understand?

350
00:25:08,245 --> 00:25:10,073
I didn't either first time I heard it.

351
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,556
Hey, we got work to do.

352
00:25:43,193 --> 00:25:45,108
- Took the liberty of stoking it.

353
00:25:45,195 --> 00:25:46,893
Got your water boiled.

354
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,590
- Well, I appreciate you saving me the time.

355
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,552
You hungry?
- Never turned down fresh meat.

356
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:55,075
- John, get washed up.

357
00:25:58,034 --> 00:26:01,211
If I take them east,

358
00:26:01,298 --> 00:26:03,910
it adds three weeks to the trip
the way they're moving.

359
00:26:03,997 --> 00:26:06,608
Puts us at South Pass in October.

360
00:26:06,695 --> 00:26:08,305
November even...

361
00:26:08,392 --> 00:26:09,306
- West is the way.

362
00:26:09,393 --> 00:26:10,917
- Gotta cross the Brazos.

363
00:26:11,004 --> 00:26:12,788
- I'll take my chances with the Brazos.

364
00:26:15,922 --> 00:26:18,751
- You said you'd help... and you're not helping.

365
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:24,234
- My wife and my daughter are out there right now

366
00:26:24,321 --> 00:26:25,801
babysitting their goddam cattle.

367
00:26:25,888 --> 00:26:27,586
- The only hope these people have

368
00:26:27,673 --> 00:26:29,631
is following without question.

369
00:26:29,718 --> 00:26:32,634
Doing exactly as I say.

370
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:34,462
Without question.

371
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:36,420
- I don't disagree.

372
00:26:36,507 --> 00:26:37,987
- You questioned.

373
00:26:38,074 --> 00:26:40,250
You questioned my authority and I cannot have it.

374
00:26:40,337 --> 00:26:42,426
- I questioned going east
and now we're going west

375
00:26:42,513 --> 00:26:43,950
and I was right to question.

376
00:26:44,037 --> 00:26:45,516
Let's get one thing straight,

377
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,780
I don't work for you and
I ain't one of your patrons.

378
00:26:47,867 --> 00:26:49,869
The only family out I give a shit about is mine.

379
00:26:49,956 --> 00:26:50,870
- You've made that clear.

380
00:26:50,957 --> 00:26:52,349
- I hope so.

381
00:27:01,532 --> 00:27:04,013
- I'm going to hold up here for three days.

382
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,319
Give you a head start.

383
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,105
- So I can flush out every bandit

384
00:27:09,192 --> 00:27:10,324
between here and West Texas?

385
00:27:12,326 --> 00:27:15,416
You go first, and I'll follow you with the herd.

386
00:27:15,503 --> 00:27:16,678
- Fair enough.

387
00:27:24,817 --> 00:27:25,774
- Come here, John.

388
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,560
Take that to the tent.

389
00:27:37,743 --> 00:27:38,744
Think I'll jerk the rest.

390
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:03,116
- <i>I always thought of mothers
like nervous chickens,</i>

391
00:28:03,203 --> 00:28:06,293
<i>too worried about their clutch
to ever hunt for a worm.</i>

392
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,818
<i>In my mind, my mother was a banker,</i>

393
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:12,473
<i>hoarding my freedom like money.</i>

394
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,605
<i>I never once thought of her as a woman</i>

395
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,652
<i>with desires and dreams and passion,</i>

396
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:20,829
<i>though passion is the thing that made me.</i>

397
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:23,179
<i>I lie awake at night</i>

398
00:28:23,266 --> 00:28:26,792
<i>and my dreams for this life burn inside me</i>

399
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:29,969
<i>as if I'd walked to the
campfire and tried to eat it.</i>

400
00:28:32,058 --> 00:28:35,670
<i>I watched my mother
and I felt foolish for thinking</i>

401
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:38,673
<i>the notion of eating fire was mine alone.</i>

402
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,720
<i>It was hers first.</i>

403
00:28:41,807 --> 00:28:42,938
<i>Then she gave it to me.</i>

404
00:28:49,858 --> 00:28:52,208
<i>I watched her ride and I didn't see my mother.</i>

405
00:28:53,514 --> 00:28:54,602
<i>I saw a woman.</i>

406
00:28:58,867 --> 00:29:00,695
<i>And the woman was magnificent.</i>

407
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:26,373
- He beat me. Destroy my wagon.

408
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,854
Strand me here, for what?

409
00:29:30,551 --> 00:29:33,032
For some gypsy whore!

410
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:34,729
- You stole from her.

411
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:37,123
- I stole back what her husband took.

412
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:39,473
- And now he's in the ground.

413
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,562
- Where he belongs.

414
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,656
- What do you want me to do?

415
00:29:48,743 --> 00:29:50,745
- We don't need them.

416
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:53,139
We go north to mountain, west to ocean.

417
00:29:53,226 --> 00:29:56,142
We don't need guide for that.

418
00:29:56,229 --> 00:30:00,842
- We need him. We need him for protection.

419
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:03,453
- Who he protect? Huh?

420
00:30:06,152 --> 00:30:10,286
Not Stefan, not David, not Luca.

421
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:13,028
Alexandria, Daria?

422
00:30:13,115 --> 00:30:14,595
No...

423
00:30:14,682 --> 00:30:16,553
Just the whore.

424
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,255
- She's a mother.

425
00:30:22,342 --> 00:30:24,431
- We can find the way without them.

426
00:30:24,518 --> 00:30:28,652
Only thing they have of use is guns and horses.

427
00:30:28,739 --> 00:30:30,002
- Then come take 'em.

428
00:30:37,444 --> 00:30:38,575
- Take three steps to the right.

429
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:42,536
- Why?

430
00:30:42,623 --> 00:30:43,972
- So I don't kill the woman standing behind you.

431
00:30:55,244 --> 00:30:56,985
Hope you had a chance to practice with that.

432
00:31:00,684 --> 00:31:01,729
You ready?

433
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:05,124
You want my horse, take it.

434
00:31:05,211 --> 00:31:07,778
Let's go. Come on!

435
00:31:13,088 --> 00:31:14,785
I can't make it much easier than that.

436
00:31:19,616 --> 00:31:20,617
Bang.

437
00:31:30,976 --> 00:31:33,935
During the war...

438
00:31:34,022 --> 00:31:37,417
we fought a battle at this place
called the wilderness,

439
00:31:37,504 --> 00:31:42,944
'cause there was nothing around but wilderness.

440
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:47,688
I fired my rifle so many times the barrel melted,

441
00:31:47,775 --> 00:31:51,344
just drooped like rotten fruit.

442
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:54,086
So, I killed with my pistol.

443
00:31:54,173 --> 00:31:56,523
And when I ran out of bullets
I killed with my sword.

444
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:01,093
And when my sword broke I killed
with my boots and bare hands.

445
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,011
When the battle was over

446
00:32:06,098 --> 00:32:11,451
and I looked behind me, the wilderness was gone.

447
00:32:11,538 --> 00:32:14,236
Not a tree left standing.

448
00:32:14,323 --> 00:32:17,631
Chopped down chest-high by bullets.

449
00:32:19,111 --> 00:32:22,853
We killed five thousand men that day.

450
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:26,770
When I say killing you means
nothing to me, I mean it.

451
00:32:26,857 --> 00:32:29,251
Killing you means nothing.

452
00:32:45,485 --> 00:32:48,096
What did I say I'd do the next time I saw you?

453
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:53,145
What did I say?

454
00:32:55,712 --> 00:32:58,672
I said I'd kill you, didn't I?

455
00:32:58,759 --> 00:32:59,542
It's what I said...

456
00:33:03,633 --> 00:33:05,853
This is your only chance
to make a liar out of me.

457
00:33:17,821 --> 00:33:19,258
I said it to you, too.

458
00:33:25,351 --> 00:33:28,093
You can police yourselves or I can do it for you.

459
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,357
Now you've seen how I do it.

460
00:33:33,794 --> 00:33:35,056
Choice is yours...

461
00:33:36,318 --> 00:33:39,104
We leave tomorrow. We head west.

462
00:33:39,191 --> 00:33:41,149
Water will be scarce.

463
00:33:41,236 --> 00:33:44,065
Take what you can carry from here.

464
00:33:44,152 --> 00:33:45,284
And boil it first.

465
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:58,210
- I don't think you're gonna
win a medal for wagon boss.

466
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,971
- Let's keep her wagon up front.

467
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,104
We can take turns driving it.

468
00:34:23,191 --> 00:34:24,932
- You think they'll come after her?

469
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:30,416
- I think they're going to go
to Fort Worth and get drunk

470
00:34:30,503 --> 00:34:34,159
and talk about all these wagons heading north,

471
00:34:34,246 --> 00:34:36,726
find some men a whole lot tougher than they are,

472
00:34:36,813 --> 00:34:38,163
and then come back for all of us.

473
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,599
- Mm.

474
00:34:43,994 --> 00:34:45,561
Maybe you should have just shot 'em.

475
00:34:45,648 --> 00:34:47,346
- I absolutely should have shot 'em.

476
00:35:00,533 --> 00:35:02,143
My daughter was one of those kids

477
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,318
who could've made the world better.

478
00:35:04,972 --> 00:35:06,756
- Yes, she was.

479
00:35:14,068 --> 00:35:16,592
- We're doing this for the same reasons, Thomas.

480
00:35:34,393 --> 00:35:39,137
- ♪ Ain't no cloud ♪

481
00:35:39,224 --> 00:35:43,010
♪ Up in the sky ♪

482
00:35:43,097 --> 00:35:48,494
♪ Ain't no worries ♪

483
00:35:48,581 --> 00:35:52,193
♪ On the horizon ♪

484
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,849
♪ Ain't no wolves ♪

485
00:35:55,936 --> 00:35:59,157
♪ Coming for your baby ♪

486
00:35:59,244 --> 00:36:01,289
- Tired?

487
00:36:01,376 --> 00:36:03,857
No, ma'am.

488
00:36:11,038 --> 00:36:13,475
Pretty proud of his voice to be
hollering it across the valley.

489
00:36:13,562 --> 00:36:15,260
- It calms the herd.

490
00:36:18,263 --> 00:36:23,442
No different than me singing
to you in the cradle.

491
00:36:23,529 --> 00:36:26,662
- They're, uh, they're bedded down pretty good.

492
00:36:26,749 --> 00:36:29,187
We can handle it from here.

493
00:36:29,274 --> 00:36:30,971
Y'all get some sleep.

494
00:36:31,058 --> 00:36:32,364
Thank you for the help.

495
00:36:43,984 --> 00:36:45,942
- Ready?

496
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,641
- I was thinkin' I'd just--

497
00:36:48,728 --> 00:36:51,557
- Let's go.

498
00:36:51,644 --> 00:36:54,473
- ♪ Rest your mind... ♪

499
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,323
- Goodnight.

500
00:37:45,045 --> 00:37:47,134
- You don't trust us to babysit cattle?

501
00:37:47,221 --> 00:37:48,744
- It's the world I don't trust.

502
00:37:51,617 --> 00:37:55,055
I do worry about your gun
fighting skills, though.

503
00:37:55,142 --> 00:37:58,841
It's been a while since you tore
into some pistoleros.

504
00:37:58,928 --> 00:38:00,365
- Watching over us.

505
00:38:00,452 --> 00:38:02,541
- Yes, ma'am.

506
00:38:02,628 --> 00:38:04,847
- Just to be sure.
- Mm-hmm.

507
00:38:04,934 --> 00:38:07,154
- Mm.

508
00:38:07,241 --> 00:38:08,286
- How'd our baby girl do?

509
00:38:11,419 --> 00:38:13,116
- Our baby girl's turning into a woman.

510
00:38:15,815 --> 00:38:17,207
- I know it.

511
00:38:20,123 --> 00:38:22,822
- She rides good.

512
00:38:22,909 --> 00:38:24,040
No fear.

513
00:38:27,043 --> 00:38:29,481
But not reckless.

514
00:38:29,568 --> 00:38:30,395
She rides like you.

515
00:38:32,658 --> 00:38:34,137
- She has her eyes on this cowboy

516
00:38:34,224 --> 00:38:35,225
and he's eyeing her right back.

517
00:38:39,578 --> 00:38:42,581
- Well... I'll shoot him first thing

518
00:38:42,668 --> 00:38:43,538
in the morning, honey.

519
00:38:46,062 --> 00:38:47,542
- I'm serious.

520
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,592
There's no gentlemen where we
are and none where we're going.

521
00:38:55,637 --> 00:38:57,247
I'm worried it's not fair.

522
00:39:02,427 --> 00:39:03,776
- Did you marry a gentleman?

523
00:39:03,863 --> 00:39:04,690
- I did not.

524
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,171
- Worked out all right for you.

525
00:39:08,258 --> 00:39:11,784
- Oh, yeah. It worked out great.

526
00:39:13,568 --> 00:39:16,528
Just like I dreamed it.

527
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,969
- What would you change?

528
00:39:26,451 --> 00:39:27,930
- Not a thing.

529
00:39:35,982 --> 00:39:38,245
I mean--

530
00:39:38,332 --> 00:39:41,770
I wouldn't mind a house.

531
00:39:41,857 --> 00:39:43,076
A big one.

532
00:39:43,163 --> 00:39:44,512
If you don't mind.

533
00:39:47,994 --> 00:39:50,388
- I'm gonna build you a house
so big, you get lost in it.

534
00:39:54,522 --> 00:39:55,567
- Deal.

535
00:39:58,308 --> 00:39:59,309
Mmm.

536
00:40:32,255 --> 00:40:33,735
- How come we ain't going?

537
00:40:33,822 --> 00:40:35,084
- We're going to follow the herd.

538
00:40:35,171 --> 00:40:36,346
- Why?

539
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,827
- A little too crowded in the front.

540
00:40:38,914 --> 00:40:41,221
- Get up on their flank along the tree-line.

541
00:40:41,308 --> 00:40:42,527
- Yes, sir.

542
00:40:49,403 --> 00:40:51,144
- If you want to court my daughter, you can.

543
00:40:53,755 --> 00:40:55,844
- Court her?

544
00:40:55,931 --> 00:40:56,976
- You can do it.

545
00:40:58,673 --> 00:40:59,674
- Not sure what it means.

546
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:04,810
- Well, son, it means you can talk, and...

547
00:41:04,897 --> 00:41:07,508
talk and go on rides and talk...

548
00:41:07,595 --> 00:41:10,206
- We've kinda been doing that.

549
00:41:10,293 --> 00:41:12,818
- You know the drill, then.

550
00:41:12,905 --> 00:41:16,299
You break her heart or get handsy...

551
00:41:16,386 --> 00:41:17,344
you and me are gonna have a problem.

552
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,129
- Define handsy.

553
00:41:26,048 --> 00:41:28,398
It was a joke.

554
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,924
And a bad... bad time to tell it.

555
00:41:32,011 --> 00:41:33,099
- Hmm.

556
00:41:33,186 --> 00:41:35,536
- Sorry... sir.

557
00:41:37,886 --> 00:41:40,280
- Goddamn, boy.

558
00:41:40,367 --> 00:41:42,804
- <i>Looking back, there were two journeys.</i>

559
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:46,678
<i>One was filled with danger and death and despair,</i>

560
00:41:46,765 --> 00:41:49,594
<i>the other, adventure and wonder.</i>

561
00:41:53,598 --> 00:41:54,947
Woop! Woop! Woop!

562
00:41:55,034 --> 00:41:56,557
<i>I was on the latter.</i>

563
00:41:56,644 --> 00:41:57,993
<i>And I loved it...</i>

564
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,649
- No, way, grab those shoulders!

565
00:42:01,736 --> 00:42:04,478
<i>- I didn't know enough to know
they would collide.</i>

566
00:42:04,565 --> 00:42:06,698
<i>I didn't know enough to know how cruel</i>

567
00:42:06,785 --> 00:42:09,875
<i>and uncaring this world can be.</i>

568
00:42:09,962 --> 00:42:13,226
<i>The world doesn't care if you die.</i>

569
00:42:13,313 --> 00:42:16,577
<i>It won't listen to your screams.</i>

570
00:42:16,664 --> 00:42:21,016
<i>If you bleed on the ground,
the ground will drink it.</i>

571
00:42:21,103 --> 00:42:24,019
<i>It doesn't care that you're cut.</i>

572
00:42:24,106 --> 00:42:27,675
<i>I told myself when I meet God</i>

573
00:42:27,762 --> 00:42:30,852
<i>it will be the first thing I ask him:</i>

574
00:42:30,939 --> 00:42:35,509
<i>why make a world of such wonder
then fill it with monsters?</i>

575
00:42:35,596 --> 00:42:39,078
<i>Why make flowers and then
snakes to hide beneath them?</i>

576
00:42:39,165 --> 00:42:44,126
<i>What purpose does the tornado serve?</i>

577
00:42:44,213 --> 00:42:45,737
<i>Then it hit me:</i>

578
00:42:47,826 --> 00:42:49,131
<i>he didn't make it for us.</i>
