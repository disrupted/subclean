Oh, babe.

00:00:15,173 --> 00:00:17,344

You know what, never mind, I'll just hurl myself

16
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,094
from the moving vehicle, okay?

17
00:00:42,127 --> 00:00:44,633
Maybe I'll die and go to hell
because that would be

18
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:46,637
an improvement on what I'm
living through at the moment.

19
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,342
- Aw, come on.
- How did we raise such a lame daughter?

20
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,580
Can't you guys be into normal gay music,

21
00:00:51,614 --> 00:00:54,185
like Britney or Madonna or even showtunes?

22
00:00:54,218 --> 00:00:55,555
Look out.

23
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:58,393
Here comes the fun police again.

24
00:00:58,426 --> 00:01:01,232
- I hate you both, seriously.
- Aw, you do not.

25
00:01:23,778 --> 00:01:26,550
Here it is. Uh‐huh.

26
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:37,739
Home sweet home.

27
00:01:37,772 --> 00:01:40,845
Come on, you. Let's go, put down that phone

28
00:01:40,878 --> 00:01:42,448
- for five minutes.

29
00:03:30,698 --> 00:03:32,267
What do you got?

30
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:34,271
- 73.
- 73 even?

31
00:03:34,305 --> 00:03:35,742
- Yep, yeah.
- Hey.

32
00:03:35,775 --> 00:03:37,244
What do you think, baby?

33
00:03:37,277 --> 00:03:39,248
Well, I haven't seen any ghosts yet.

34
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:41,352
And you won't, because ghosts don't exist.

35
00:03:41,385 --> 00:03:43,557
Uh‐uh, hey, don't ever say that again.

36
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:45,828
- Why?
- It'll destroy our whole marketing strategy.

37
00:03:45,862 --> 00:03:48,266
Am I still gonna be able
to go to college after you guys

38
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:49,836
burn all of our money renovating this place?

39
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,776
Are you aware of what
the seventh‐most popular ride

40
00:03:52,809 --> 00:03:54,780
- at Disneyland is?
- Minnie Mouse?

41
00:03:54,813 --> 00:03:56,315
Oh, yes, that's funny.

42
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:57,418
No.

43
00:03:57,451 --> 00:03:58,788
It's the Haunted Mansion.

44
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,023
And did you know what the third‐most

45
00:04:00,056 --> 00:04:02,428
popular holiday in America is?

46
00:04:02,461 --> 00:04:04,800
Halloween. And Christmas is actually

47
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,402
second to Thanksgiving, believe it or not.

48
00:04:06,436 --> 00:04:08,306
People love to be scared.

49
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:10,377
Psychiatrists say that
the kind of controlled fear

50
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,880
that you get from a roller‐coaster

51
00:04:11,914 --> 00:04:14,653
or a haunted house or a‐a bungee jump‐‐

52
00:04:14,686 --> 00:04:15,955
it's like a vaccination.

53
00:04:15,988 --> 00:04:17,592
A little bit of the anxiety virus

54
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,863
helps you with healing your overall anxiety.

55
00:04:19,896 --> 00:04:21,767
Honey, this place is maybe the most famous

56
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,336
haunted house on the west coast.

57
00:04:23,369 --> 00:04:25,040
We're gonna offer haunted getaways

58
00:04:25,073 --> 00:04:27,946
and haunted honeymoons
and sleepover party massacres.

59
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:30,050
All kinds of branded stays.

60
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,753
All with the best coffee and homemade pastries

61
00:04:31,787 --> 00:04:33,657
in the city for breakfast.

62
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,563
- If you survive...
- Oh, my God.

63
00:04:36,597 --> 00:04:38,701
- Oh, my God.
- the night.

64
00:04:38,734 --> 00:04:41,673
- Stop. Stop.
- Aah!

65
00:04:46,382 --> 00:04:49,054
So you guys are not concerned about the fact

66
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:50,858
that people actually, like, died here?

67
00:04:50,892 --> 00:04:52,595
You know, whole families, the curse?

68
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:55,701
Come on, ghosts aren't real
and curses aren't real.

69
00:04:55,735 --> 00:04:57,972
People do terrible,
horrible things to each other.

70
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,010
They don't need the help of an evil spirit

71
00:05:00,043 --> 00:05:02,615
to do them. Your father doesn't
believe that and neither do I.

72
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:03,884
This place just seems to have attracted

73
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:05,020
some bad folks, that's all.

74
00:05:05,053 --> 00:05:06,355
And we're gonna take advantage

75
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,424
of that to make some dough.

76
00:05:08,828 --> 00:05:12,467
Hey, you didn't get a vote in all this.

77
00:05:12,502 --> 00:05:14,004
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:16,042
Are you really frightened about being here?

79
00:05:16,075 --> 00:05:17,579
No, not at all.

80
00:05:17,612 --> 00:05:18,848
I just...

81
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:20,551
I liked our old house.

82
00:05:20,585 --> 00:05:22,956
But I like that I didn't have to change schools.

83
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,793
Honestly, what I'm scared of is you guys fucking

84
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:26,830
this plan up and us ending up homeless.

85
00:05:26,864 --> 00:05:29,034
Honey, I love your practical side.

86
00:05:29,068 --> 00:05:32,509
I do. But this isn't about
practicality, this is our dream.

87
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:34,411
- We're house flippers, we're dreamers.
- Right.

88
00:05:34,445 --> 00:05:36,015
I promise you, even if it doesn't work out,

89
00:05:36,048 --> 00:05:37,519
we will never be homeless and college

90
00:05:37,552 --> 00:05:39,021
- will be paid for, okay?
- Never.

91
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:40,758
- Okay?
- Promise.

92
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,461
- Come on, come on, come on.
- I guess.

93
00:05:42,495 --> 00:05:44,064
- Bring it in.
- Come here.

94
00:05:44,098 --> 00:05:45,668
Mwah.

95
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:47,872
It's gonna be good, hon.

96
00:05:47,906 --> 00:05:49,576
Hey, you want to go upstairs and look at the tile

97
00:05:49,609 --> 00:05:51,379
- for the second bedroom?
- Yes. Oh, my gosh.

98
00:05:51,412 --> 00:05:53,851
- Let's go. Bye.
- That grouting is a mess. Bye, sweetheart.

99
00:05:53,884 --> 00:05:55,922
- I think it's the... I don't think we can
- It's the grout.

100
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:58,026
- replace those tiles.
- It's just bad grout, that's all it is.

101
00:06:58,948 --> 00:07:00,918
Dad?

102
00:10:08,326 --> 00:10:10,130
- The amygdala,

103
00:10:10,163 --> 00:10:11,833
in the front portion of the temporal lobe.

104
00:10:11,867 --> 00:10:14,271
When you get scared, this is

105
00:10:14,304 --> 00:10:16,108
the part of the brain that starts firing.

106
00:10:16,142 --> 00:10:17,879
So, like, why doesn't the Army

107
00:10:17,912 --> 00:10:19,414
shoot a laser or something
on that part of the brain

108
00:10:19,448 --> 00:10:21,720
so that soldiers won't ever
be afraid of anything?

109
00:10:21,753 --> 00:10:23,356
It doesn't work that way.

110
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,993
Though people who have suffered damage

111
00:10:25,026 --> 00:10:26,663
to that part of the brain can become

112
00:10:26,696 --> 00:10:28,634
fearless, but they also lose

113
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:30,805
their ability to feel other emotions.

114
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,875
Or perceive what other people are feeling.

115
00:10:32,909 --> 00:10:35,213
- I'd be good with that in
exchange for being a Terminator.

116
00:10:35,246 --> 00:10:38,019
- You have a different opinion, Scarlett?

117
00:10:39,254 --> 00:10:42,160
I mean, it's easy to not be afraid.

118
00:10:42,194 --> 00:10:43,897
People do it all the time.

119
00:10:43,931 --> 00:10:45,868
They... get on airplanes

120
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:47,839
and drive really fast in their cars

121
00:10:47,872 --> 00:10:49,976
and ask people out on dates.

122
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:52,147
Fear isn't what stops us from doing what we want.

123
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,819
- So then what does?
- Shame.

124
00:10:59,729 --> 00:11:02,267
Shame is what keeps us
from being our true selves.

125
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,438
I bet everybody in here could face their fear

126
00:11:04,471 --> 00:11:06,408
with enough encouragement, but...

127
00:11:06,442 --> 00:11:09,014
not one would be able to face their shame.

128
00:11:10,818 --> 00:11:13,189
- Looks like someone's

129
00:11:13,222 --> 00:11:14,859
feeling shame about something.

130
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,799
You know, if a boy stared at me like that,

131
00:11:34,832 --> 00:11:36,836
I'd probably report him for harassment.

132
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,807
God, I'm so sorry.

133
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,778
I haven't been sleeping super well.

134
00:11:40,811 --> 00:11:42,147
I'm just kind of out of it.

135
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,817
I didn't say I didn't like it.

136
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,925
Smart is the new perfect ten.

137
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:53,737
What was that?

138
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,841
I think she was flirting with me.

139
00:11:55,874 --> 00:11:57,177
Tell me every word.

140
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,880
Sounds off to me.

141
00:11:58,914 --> 00:12:00,818
Dude, I know when a girl's coming on to me, okay?

142
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:04,358
- How?
- Because they're actually, like,
talking to me and smiling

143
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,796
instead of calling be a bitch
or a dyke or whatever.

144
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,502
- Dude, Maya's a professional actress.
- No, she's not.

145
00:12:09,535 --> 00:12:11,773
She's a model. Also, she's barely even a model.

146
00:12:11,806 --> 00:12:13,242
She just did one ad for Sprouts Market.

147
00:12:13,276 --> 00:12:15,781
- She's fucking with you.
- No, she's not.

148
00:12:15,814 --> 00:12:17,518
You're so smart.

149
00:12:17,551 --> 00:12:19,221
You'd see right through this

150
00:12:19,254 --> 00:12:21,025

- Hey.

168
00:15:53,249 --> 00:15:54,619
Getting started early?

169
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:56,388
Yeah.

170
00:15:56,421 --> 00:15:57,992
You know, it wouldn't kill you
to help out a little.

171
00:15:58,025 --> 00:15:59,529
This is your house, too.

172
00:15:59,562 --> 00:16:02,200
Okay, I'll stop doing homework
and grab a toolbelt.

173
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,141
Honey, sit down.

174
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:08,045
We want to talk to you about something.

175
00:16:11,285 --> 00:16:15,494
About a year ago,
I found some pretty extreme porn

176
00:16:15,527 --> 00:16:17,765
- on your computer.
- We have to go through this again?

177
00:16:17,798 --> 00:16:21,071
I told you guys I'm not looking
at that stuff anymore.

178
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:22,508
That is what you told us.

179
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:23,777
You gave us your word.

180
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,547
Which is why it is so disappointing

181
00:16:25,581 --> 00:16:27,016
that you still are.

182
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,285
In fact, it looks like you moved on

183
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:30,156
to even more disturbing material.

184
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,561
I don't know what you guys are talking about.

185
00:16:33,563 --> 00:16:37,070
We hired an IT guy to give us
the ability to look at

186
00:16:37,103 --> 00:16:39,040
all of the Internet searches and sites

187
00:16:39,074 --> 00:16:40,611
visited on our home server.

188
00:16:40,644 --> 00:16:42,615
You've been spying on me?!

189
00:16:42,648 --> 00:16:44,117
- You've been lying to us.
- About what‐‐

190
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,554
what kind of porn I like to look at?

191
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,423
What the fuck am I supposed to do?

192
00:16:47,457 --> 00:16:50,296
- It's none of your business.
- Honey, you are 16 years old.

193
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:52,735
Okay, now, there's‐there's nothing wrong

194
00:16:52,768 --> 00:16:56,509
with you expressing yourself
sexually with a little...

195
00:16:56,543 --> 00:16:58,312
pain or bondage.

196
00:16:58,345 --> 00:17:00,684
I mean, your dad and I have done and seen it all.

197
00:17:00,717 --> 00:17:03,322
But these sites‐‐ the level of
physical pain and humiliation

198
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,393
that these girls are suffering‐‐

199
00:17:05,426 --> 00:17:08,299
it's just not good for
your young brain to see that.

200
00:17:08,332 --> 00:17:10,537
It's being wired right now, Scarlett.

201
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,510
I mean, it's‐it's gonna be hard for you

202
00:17:13,543 --> 00:17:16,315
to have normal sex
after seeing some of this stuff.

203
00:17:16,348 --> 00:17:18,452
I look at vanilla stuff, too, sometimes.

204
00:17:18,485 --> 00:17:21,158
Mm‐mmm. Hardly ever.

205
00:17:22,728 --> 00:17:25,333
Honey, can I ask you something?

206
00:17:25,366 --> 00:17:27,705
When you watch these things,

207
00:17:27,738 --> 00:17:30,611
do you fantasize about being
the masochist or the sadist?

208
00:17:30,644 --> 00:17:32,514
Okay, this is way too fucked‐up

209
00:17:32,548 --> 00:17:35,219
a conversation to have
with your parents, all right?

210
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:36,789
I'm sorry I looked at that stuff

211
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:38,325
when I told you guys I wouldn't. Bye.

212
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,096
Nope. No. That is not good enough.

213
00:17:40,129 --> 00:17:43,168
Okay? We're gonna want you to see a therapist.

214
00:17:43,202 --> 00:17:46,475
To find out what‐‐
why pain and shame turns me on?

215
00:17:46,509 --> 00:17:48,245
It turn every girl on.

216
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:49,615
Haven't you seen Fifty Shades of Grey?

217
00:17:49,649 --> 00:17:52,186
No, this is not just shame and pain.

218
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,659
- It's violence.
- We are putting a child lock on the Internet

219
00:17:54,692 --> 00:17:57,463
and you are grounded
this weekend for lying to us.

220
00:17:57,498 --> 00:17:59,434
Wh‐What? No. You can't.

221
00:17:59,467 --> 00:18:01,506
I‐I have a slumber party to go to.

222
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,142
Whose?

223
00:18:03,175 --> 00:18:06,148
This girl Maya, who I like, and her friends.

224
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,588
I'm sorry, okay? I'll do whatever you want.

225
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,793
I'll go to therapy, just...

226
00:18:11,826 --> 00:18:13,563
please...

227
00:18:13,597 --> 00:18:15,399
don't take this from me.

228
00:18:17,538 --> 00:18:18,840
Fine.

229
00:18:18,873 --> 00:18:20,577
But you are seeing a therapist.

230
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:22,113
She'll be at the house tomorrow.

231
00:18:22,146 --> 00:18:23,750
Hey.

232
00:18:23,783 --> 00:18:25,353
No more lying.

233
00:18:25,386 --> 00:18:28,158
Honey, we're understanding parents.

234
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:29,829
We're not uptight.

235
00:18:29,862 --> 00:18:31,799
I mean, I got photos of Michael

236
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,737
at the Folsom Street Fair
from before you were born

237
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,206
that will prove that.

238
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,811
But there is a line when sex stops

239
00:18:37,845 --> 00:18:40,617
and something very dark and unhealthy starts.

240
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:42,554
Okay?

241
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,859
Okay.

242
00:18:44,892 --> 00:18:47,498
I understand.

243
00:18:47,531 --> 00:18:48,767
Love you.

244
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,804
Hey, we love you, too, sweetheart.

245
00:18:50,837 --> 00:18:53,175
Love you too. Uh...

246
00:18:56,248 --> 00:18:58,352
- I think it went well.

247
00:18:58,385 --> 00:19:00,189
- Yeah.

248
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,926
Okay.

249
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:03,530
The largest part of the human brain

250
00:19:03,563 --> 00:19:04,865
is the cerebrum,

251
00:19:04,899 --> 00:19:06,569
which is divided into two hemispheres.

252
00:19:06,602 --> 00:19:09,274
And underneath lies the brain stem,

253
00:19:09,307 --> 00:19:11,445
and behind that sits the cerebellum.

254
00:19:11,478 --> 00:19:13,817
The outermost layer of the cerebrum

255
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,419
- is the cerebral cortex,

256
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:18,325
which consists of four lobes‐‐ the frontal,

257
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:20,697
parietal, temporal and occipital.

258
00:19:20,731 --> 00:19:22,868
Like all vertebrae brains,

259
00:19:22,901 --> 00:19:25,741
the human brain develops from three sections

260
00:19:25,774 --> 00:19:28,880
known as the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain.

261
00:20:14,003 --> 00:20:16,475
Fuck me.

262
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:09,067
What the hell? Troy!

263
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,570
What?

264
00:22:10,604 --> 00:22:12,340
- Scarlett, you okay?
- Who are you?

265
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:14,778
I'm gonna call 911. Just get out of our house.

266
00:22:14,812 --> 00:22:16,348
Get out of our fucking house!

267
00:22:19,989 --> 00:22:21,492
Gotcha.

268
00:22:21,526 --> 00:22:23,663
- Oh, my God. Scarlett.
- What?

269
00:22:23,696 --> 00:22:25,399
- What the hell are you doing?
- Oh, my...

270
00:22:25,432 --> 00:22:27,069
- Where did you get that suit?
- Jesus.

271
00:22:27,103 --> 00:22:28,606
I found it in the house.

272
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,975
I threw it away,

273
00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:32,848
but I thought you guys put it back in my closet.

274
00:22:32,881 --> 00:22:34,450
A used S and M suit?

275
00:22:34,484 --> 00:22:35,820
Why the fuck would we do that?

276
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,123
I don't know.

277
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:38,993
- Isn't it cool, though?
- No.

278
00:22:39,027 --> 00:22:40,897
- Were you scared?
- Go take that thing off.

279
00:22:40,931 --> 00:22:42,701
And go take a very hot shower.

280
00:22:42,734 --> 00:22:44,905
- I don't ever want to see that again.
- No, I'm keeping it.

281
00:22:44,939 --> 00:22:46,742
Oh, my God. Absolutely not.

282
00:22:46,776 --> 00:22:48,613
God, you guys think you can
control every part of me.

283
00:22:48,646 --> 00:22:50,984
Well, guess what‐‐ it is my body and my mind,

284
00:22:51,017 --> 00:22:53,155
- and you can't control it.
- Yeah? Okay, fine.

285
00:22:53,188 --> 00:22:54,758
- Then I'm gonna tear it off you
and I'm gonna throw it...
- Stop! No!

286
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:56,862
- Ow! Fuck.
- Oh, my God. Daddy, I'm sorry.

287
00:22:56,896 --> 00:22:58,733
- Okay, hang on, hang on.
- I'm sorry.

288
00:22:58,766 --> 00:23:00,837
- Fuck.
- Okay, here, babe.

289
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,741
You think you need stitches?

290
00:23:02,774 --> 00:23:06,616
- I do. Fuck.
- Okay, okay. Let's get you dressed, okay?

291
00:23:06,649 --> 00:23:08,820
- I think there's an urgent care nearby.
- Let me come with you.

292
00:23:08,853 --> 00:23:10,456
No. Just go to your room.

293
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:11,759
You can come out to throw away

294
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:13,496
that awful costume, but that is it.

295
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:14,899
And please be aware, young lady,

296
00:23:14,932 --> 00:23:17,470
I will not be talking to you for weeks.

297
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,009
 Just let me...

298
00:23:39,147 --> 00:23:42,053
found that only 17% of young women under 18

299
00:23:42,086 --> 00:23:44,057
watched porn for sexual excitement.

300
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,696
and only 0.3 of them watched violent porn.

301
00:23:46,729 --> 00:23:48,833
So you're saying I'm a freak.

302
00:23:48,866 --> 00:23:50,770
I'm saying that when someone's
behavior is atypical,

303
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,774
it's worth exploring the reasons why.

304
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:54,878
Scarlett, you're not a freak.

305
00:23:54,912 --> 00:23:57,651
You're not weird or defective in any way.

306
00:23:57,684 --> 00:23:59,655
What turns you on turns you on.

307
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,559
The only reason why we have to get into this

308
00:24:01,592 --> 00:24:04,030
is because last night
you acted out in a violent way.

309
00:24:04,063 --> 00:24:06,468
That was an accident.
I never would have hurt my dads.

310
00:24:06,502 --> 00:24:08,573
Honey, then why scare us like that?

311
00:24:08,606 --> 00:24:10,710
I don't know, 'cause I thought
it was funny or something.

312
00:24:10,744 --> 00:24:12,948
We prank each other all the time, don't we?

313
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,787
Uh, she's not wrong about that. We do.

314
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,493
I mean, one time we challenged Troy

315
00:24:18,526 --> 00:24:19,795
to a water balloon fight

316
00:24:19,828 --> 00:24:21,699
but we filled our balloons with paint.

317
00:24:21,732 --> 00:24:22,934
Yeah, and one time I changed

318
00:24:22,968 --> 00:24:24,938
Michael's iPhone language to Chinese.

319
00:24:24,972 --> 00:24:26,976
He had to take it to
the Apple Store to get it fixed.

320
00:24:28,011 --> 00:24:29,581
So you think dressing up in a costume

321
00:24:29,615 --> 00:24:31,585
and threatening your dads with a knife

322
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:33,088
is in the same ballpark of fun and games

323
00:24:33,121 --> 00:24:35,760
as changing a language on an iPhone?

324
00:24:36,762 --> 00:24:38,098
Uh, we tend to be

325
00:24:38,131 --> 00:24:40,002
a little overprotective. Um...

326
00:24:42,006 --> 00:24:44,143
When Scarlett was three, she was kidnapped.

327
00:24:45,647 --> 00:24:47,116
I was, uh, at the market.

328
00:24:47,149 --> 00:24:48,553
And I...

329
00:24:48,586 --> 00:24:50,724
I put her in her car seat first.

330
00:24:52,193 --> 00:24:53,963
And then I went around back

331
00:24:53,997 --> 00:24:55,967
to put the groceries in the trunk.

332
00:25:04,117 --> 00:25:05,887
While I was back there, someone stole the car

333
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,223
with Scarlett in it.

334
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,526
What are you doing?

335
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,162
No, that's my daughter!

336
00:25:10,195 --> 00:25:13,569
No! No!

337
00:25:13,603 --> 00:25:15,573
Scarlett!

338
00:25:15,607 --> 00:25:18,613
- That's terrible.
- Yeah, she was missing for ten days.

339
00:25:18,646 --> 00:25:22,253
They found the car right away,
but no sign of Scarlett.

340
00:25:22,286 --> 00:25:24,558
- It was all over the news.
- Mm‐hmm.

341
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:27,129
Finally, a pediatrician's office
called the police.

342
00:25:27,163 --> 00:25:29,535
This woman had brought a three‐year‐old girl in

343
00:25:29,568 --> 00:25:31,739
for a checkup without any information

344
00:25:31,772 --> 00:25:33,810
about her "daughter's" medical history.

345
00:25:33,843 --> 00:25:36,782
Turns out that this woman
had just lost her own daughter.

346
00:25:36,816 --> 00:25:39,320
Her ex‐husband had murdered the child.

347
00:25:39,353 --> 00:25:41,224
I guess it just drove the poor woman mad.

348
00:25:41,257 --> 00:25:43,095
She went looking for a replacement.

349
00:25:44,865 --> 00:25:47,704
Scarlett, do you remember
anything about those ten days?

350
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:51,077
Not really.

351
00:25:51,111 --> 00:25:53,850
I mean, I don't even remember being scared

352
00:25:53,883 --> 00:25:56,287
or anyone trying to hurt me or anything.

353
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,826
She didn't have a scratch on her.

354
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,231
I mean, we're the ones who were
the most traumatized by it.

355
00:26:02,901 --> 00:26:04,938
But then, when we saw the porn sites

356
00:26:04,972 --> 00:26:07,744
and the suit we got worried

357
00:26:07,778 --> 00:26:11,719
that maybe she had been affected.

358
00:26:13,288 --> 00:26:16,027
Maybe.

359
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,165
What I'm most worried about is this house.

360
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,237
Scarlett, you've heard all the stories

361
00:26:21,271 --> 00:26:22,941
about what happened here, right?

362
00:26:22,974 --> 00:26:25,847
Yeah. Like Amityville Horror on crystal meth.

363
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,951
Do you think it's been challenging,

364
00:26:27,984 --> 00:26:29,320
emotionally, moving in here?

365
00:26:29,353 --> 00:26:30,957
I'm sorry, we don't believe

366
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,359
- in haunted houses.

367
00:26:32,393 --> 00:26:34,063
Seriously, why would a spirit stick around

368
00:26:34,097 --> 00:26:36,301
on Earth when it has
the whole universe to explore?

369
00:26:36,334 --> 00:26:38,105
The stories are absurd.

370
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,875
We believe in science in this family.

371
00:26:39,908 --> 00:26:42,814
I don't believe in haunted houses, either.

372
00:26:42,848 --> 00:26:46,054
But I do believe that knowing
what dark things have occurred

373
00:26:46,087 --> 00:26:49,928
in a place can create a darkness
in someone's psyche.

374
00:26:49,962 --> 00:26:53,235
It's the reason why cemeteries feel scary

375
00:26:53,268 --> 00:26:57,042
or old dungeons or "haunted" houses.

376
00:26:58,178 --> 00:27:00,115
If we know what terrible things

377
00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:01,685
have happened in a place,

378
00:27:01,719 --> 00:27:03,221
then we are forced to confront the truth

379
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:05,727
that terrible things can happen at all.

380
00:27:07,263 --> 00:27:08,766
I mean, it's impossible not to get

381
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,837
a little dark, a little depressed.

382
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,208
It affects all of us.

383
00:27:13,241 --> 00:27:15,245
I‐I felt it myself when I came in here.

384
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,749
A heaviness in the air.

385
00:27:16,782 --> 00:27:18,418
See? It's all your fault.

386
00:27:18,451 --> 00:27:20,355
I didn't say that.

387
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,259
I'm sorry, we have to end.

388
00:27:22,293 --> 00:27:23,963
- But we're not‐we're not done.

389
00:27:23,996 --> 00:27:25,733
Can we pay you for another hour?

390
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:27,369
I have another client
all the way over in Brentwood.

391
00:27:27,403 --> 00:27:29,842
- But I would like to see all of you next week.
- Yes.

392
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:32,948
- And Scarlett alone later this week.
- Great.

393
00:27:32,981 --> 00:27:35,820
You can set all that up with my office.

394
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:37,757
- Would you mind if I used
the restroom before I go?
- No.

395
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:39,862
Oh, sure, it's the third door down that hall.

396
00:27:39,895 --> 00:27:42,099
Thank you. I'll see myself out.

397
00:27:44,003 --> 00:27:45,673
Definitely no slumber party tonight, though.

398
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:47,409
What? No.

399
00:27:47,443 --> 00:27:49,347
Hey, your father has six stitches in his arm.

400
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,752
I'm sorry, you'll have to see
this girl next weekend.

401
00:27:51,785 --> 00:27:53,823
Fuck you! Fuck both of you! You heard her.

402
00:27:53,856 --> 00:27:57,797
This is all because you moved us
into this stupid fucking house.

403
00:27:57,831 --> 00:28:00,369
I wish that kidnapper would have kept me!

404
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:04,443
- So do we.
- Michael.

405
00:28:04,477 --> 00:28:06,414
Sorry. Sorry, I went dark.

406
00:28:06,447 --> 00:28:08,819
- That's not helpful.
- Sorry, honey.

407
00:28:26,889 --> 00:28:28,793
Scarlett?

408
00:28:30,964 --> 00:28:33,235
Is anyone there?

409
00:28:37,877 --> 00:28:39,915
Hello?

410
00:28:49,835 --> 00:28:51,839
 You are going to die in there.

411
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:24,003
 The fuck?

412
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,375
- Whose blood was that?
- I don't know.

413
00:29:43,408 --> 00:29:45,880
Hers, maybe? Time of the month?

414
00:29:45,913 --> 00:29:47,984
Oh, right.

415
00:29:48,018 --> 00:29:50,890
It would also explain how bitchy she's been.

416
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:54,531
You want to get blitzed on Xanax
and edibles and watch The Crown?

417
00:29:54,564 --> 00:29:57,436
- Oh, hell yes.
- All right, let's go.

White Claw's the taste of our generation.

443
00:31:51,397 --> 00:31:54,403
- That really says it all, doesn't it?
- What do you mean?

444
00:31:54,437 --> 00:31:56,307
We drink booze that doesn't taste like booze,

445
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,512
we smoke without inhaling any smoke.

446
00:31:58,546 --> 00:32:00,983
Don't you guys ever worry
that everything about us

447
00:32:01,017 --> 00:32:03,188
is, like, totally fake?

448
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,390
Like your nose?

449
00:32:09,266 --> 00:32:12,106
No, that makes sense. I know what you mean.

450
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:15,178
See? You're the only one here who isn't fake.

451
00:32:15,212 --> 00:32:17,984
You say what you want even if
people make fun of you for it,

452
00:32:18,017 --> 00:32:21,057
and you don't, like, conform
to the superficial standards

453
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,527
that everybody else does.

454
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,664
Like, shaving your pits or brushing your hair.

455
00:32:24,698 --> 00:32:26,334
- No, I...

456
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:29,006
I mean it in a nice way.

457
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,676
You're more confident than any of us.

458
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,212
You think it's 'cause you're lezzie?

459
00:32:32,246 --> 00:32:34,584
Nicole. She's not officially out.

460
00:32:34,618 --> 00:32:36,287
No, it's okay.

461
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,626
I don't know. I mean...

462
00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:41,598
I'm sure it helps to not have
to try to impress some dude

463
00:32:41,632 --> 00:32:44,003
that only cares about how a girl looks.

464
00:32:44,036 --> 00:32:46,274
And I'm not not out, I just don't need

465
00:32:46,307 --> 00:32:48,546
everybody at school to fetishizing my sex life.

466
00:32:48,579 --> 00:32:50,182
You're a virgin?

467
00:32:50,215 --> 00:32:52,152
How does a lesbian determine if she's a virgin?

468
00:32:52,186 --> 00:32:54,456
Eating pussy, definitely.

469
00:32:56,327 --> 00:32:59,501
I just think it's something
you know when you know.

470
00:32:59,534 --> 00:33:02,306
- Scarlett, how come
you haven't put on your pajamas?

471
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:04,310
Oh, I didn't bring any. I snuck out.

472
00:33:04,343 --> 00:33:06,347
My dads are passed out, but I'm gonna

473
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,318
have to sneak back in before they wake up.

474
00:33:08,351 --> 00:33:09,654
It's a slumber party.

475
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:11,457
You need to be wearing pajamas.

476
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,498
I'll lend you a pair of mine.

477
00:33:17,236 --> 00:33:18,706

478
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,580

480
00:33:38,378 --> 00:33:42,119
So, these...

481
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:45,091
...are shorties.

482
00:33:56,782 --> 00:33:58,519
Wow.

483
00:34:00,523 --> 00:34:02,059
Those are nice.

484
00:34:03,194 --> 00:34:04,531
Thanks.

485
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,206
I... wore them for you.

486
00:34:35,292 --> 00:34:36,495
What are you doing?

487
00:34:37,462 --> 00:34:38,699
What do you mean?

488
00:34:38,732 --> 00:34:41,270
Are you experimenting

489
00:34:41,304 --> 00:34:44,209
or think you might be gay

490
00:34:44,243 --> 00:34:48,652
or are you just fucking with me?

491
00:34:52,794 --> 00:34:54,664
I'm not fucking with you.

492
00:34:56,635 --> 00:34:58,672
Not really sure about the other two.

493
00:34:58,706 --> 00:35:01,177
- But...

494
00:35:02,479 --> 00:35:03,849
...does it matter?

495
00:35:18,344 --> 00:35:20,315
I am.

496
00:35:20,348 --> 00:35:22,386
What?

497
00:35:22,419 --> 00:35:24,189
A virgin.

498
00:35:25,225 --> 00:35:26,662
Well...

499
00:35:28,499 --> 00:35:29,768
...that's a problem,

500
00:35:29,801 --> 00:35:33,174
'cause I was kind of counting on you

501
00:35:33,207 --> 00:35:34,343
to know what to do.

502
00:35:37,817 --> 00:35:40,355
You've watched porn, haven't you?

503
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,627
I don't think the kind of porn I watch

504
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,463
would really be helpful.

505
00:35:44,497 --> 00:35:45,900
Why?

506
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:52,412
It's okay. You can tell me.

507
00:35:52,446 --> 00:35:55,519
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

508
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,857
I promise I won't judge.

509
00:36:02,767 --> 00:36:06,240
I like violent stuff.

510
00:36:07,275 --> 00:36:11,585
Extreme S and M, pain.

511
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:16,928
That sounds hot.

512
00:36:20,669 --> 00:36:23,241
Tell me more.

513
00:36:23,274 --> 00:36:24,410
Really?

514
00:36:26,414 --> 00:36:28,952
Okay.

515
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:32,392
One person

516
00:36:32,426 --> 00:36:35,933
- will tie up another person tight,

517
00:36:35,966 --> 00:36:38,639
in really

518
00:36:38,672 --> 00:36:40,776
painful positions.

519
00:36:42,279 --> 00:36:45,351
And then they'll use things on them.

520
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,525
Wooden crop.

521
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:51,330
Anything that leaves a real mark.

522
00:36:52,967 --> 00:36:55,371
Jesus. Oh, sorry.

523
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:22,392
Wow. How fucking weird did that get?

524
00:37:51,016 --> 00:37:54,724
Shanti, how much could they hear?

525
00:37:54,757 --> 00:37:56,393
The whole thing.

526
00:37:56,427 --> 00:37:58,765
They saw you changing and everything.

527
00:37:58,799 --> 00:38:01,337
Oh, God, oh, God.

528
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:03,775
The whole thing?

529
00:38:03,809 --> 00:38:08,017
Everybody thinks I'm a pervert or something.

530
00:38:10,523 --> 00:38:13,394
What do the comments say?

531
00:38:13,427 --> 00:38:16,433
Just don't look. Please.

532
00:38:21,912 --> 00:38:25,485
My life is over.

533
00:39:00,723 --> 00:39:02,493
Dad?

534
00:39:05,766 --> 00:39:07,803
Dad?

535
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,958
Hello. Violent porn hotline.

536
00:39:34,991 --> 00:39:37,763
- Are you addicted to pain? We can help.

537
00:39:37,797 --> 00:39:39,701
Hi, Maya.

538
00:39:39,734 --> 00:39:41,638
I just want you to know

539
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:44,577
- that was the most fun we've had in weeks.
- I know.

540
00:39:44,611 --> 00:39:47,115
Fun's not over yet.

541
00:39:47,148 --> 00:39:49,119
I'm gonna end the night by killing myself.

542
00:39:49,152 --> 00:39:50,723
Bullshit.

543
00:39:50,756 --> 00:39:52,459
No.

544
00:39:52,493 --> 00:39:55,098
You humiliated me.

545
00:39:55,131 --> 00:39:57,469
Everyone at school saw it.

546
00:39:57,503 --> 00:39:59,707
So I'm gonna commit suicide

547
00:39:59,741 --> 00:40:01,443
and leave a note saying very clearly

548
00:40:01,477 --> 00:40:02,880
that you guys are the reason why.

549
00:40:04,049 --> 00:40:05,586
Remember that case at Rutgers

550
00:40:05,619 --> 00:40:07,455
where those guys outed a kid

551
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:09,827
by secret web cam and he
ended up killing himself?

552
00:40:11,498 --> 00:40:14,136
The assholes who filmed him were arrested

553
00:40:14,169 --> 00:40:16,140
and kicked out of school.

554
00:40:16,173 --> 00:40:20,148
They spent five years in court and time in jail.

555
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:22,152
They're all convicted felons now.

556
00:40:22,185 --> 00:40:25,926
Scarlett, wait. We were just messing around.

557
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,001
If you're not at my house
in half an hour‐‐ all of you‐‐

558
00:40:30,034 --> 00:40:32,138
I'm gonna do it.

559
00:40:32,172 --> 00:40:35,044
And your fake, shitty lives will be over.

560
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,483
I'm not going in there.

561
00:40:54,517 --> 00:40:56,186
- It's haunted.
- It's true.

562
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,659
I went on this horror tour of L. A.

563
00:40:58,692 --> 00:41:01,598
They call it the Murder House.

564
00:41:01,631 --> 00:41:03,167
We have to.

565
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,038
If she kills herself, we're fucked.

566
00:41:05,071 --> 00:41:06,608
I'll wait in the car.

567
00:41:06,641 --> 00:41:08,044
Someone's got to be the getaway driver.

568
00:41:08,077 --> 00:41:09,614
We're all going in there together.

569
00:41:09,647 --> 00:41:11,885
What's she gonna do? There's four of us.

570
00:41:11,918 --> 00:41:13,555
Come on.

571
00:41:38,672 --> 00:41:40,041
Scarlett?

572
00:41:55,939 --> 00:41:58,678
- Oh, my God.
- It's just the wind.

573
00:41:58,712 --> 00:42:00,281
Come on.

574
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,757
We're locked in.

575
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,159
She's fucking with us.

576
00:42:39,192 --> 00:42:41,865
She's probably filming this to embarrass us.

577
00:42:41,898 --> 00:42:43,033
Don't make a fool of yourself.

578
00:43:00,769 --> 00:43:02,005
Scarlett?

579
00:43:05,779 --> 00:43:07,282
Scarlett?

580
00:43:22,345 --> 00:43:24,282

Did I do a good job?

608
00:45:04,115 --> 00:45:06,854
Yeah, it's perfect.

609
00:45:06,888 --> 00:45:08,725
It's flush. All the joints are straight,

610
00:45:08,758 --> 00:45:09,894
the mortar's tidy.

611
00:45:09,927 --> 00:45:11,831
This is really good work.

612
00:45:11,864 --> 00:45:14,302
But why are you doing this? This is strange.

613
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:16,039
Well, you told me to help out more around here.

614
00:45:16,073 --> 00:45:19,112
Plus, I thought it'd be a fun project to try.

615
00:45:19,145 --> 00:45:21,751
So... look, I'm really sorry

616
00:45:21,784 --> 00:45:24,256
about being a jerk and lying to you guys.

617
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:26,895
So you just stayed up all night doing this...

618
00:45:26,928 --> 00:45:28,498
for penance?

619
00:45:28,531 --> 00:45:32,038
Yeah. I mean, actions
speak louder than words, right?

620
00:45:32,071 --> 00:45:34,009
- Oh, hon.
- Careful, I'm a little gross.

621
00:45:34,042 --> 00:45:36,981
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

622
00:45:37,015 --> 00:45:38,919
Hey, we're sorry, too.

623
00:45:38,952 --> 00:45:41,156
I know all this change is hard

624
00:45:41,189 --> 00:45:43,460
and we're not really good at
helping you with your feelings.

625
00:45:43,495 --> 00:45:46,400
You try. Which is more than most kids get.

626
00:45:46,433 --> 00:45:47,903
- Hey, how about some breakfast?

627
00:45:47,937 --> 00:45:49,205
I'm making acai smoothies.

628
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:51,209
Yeah, let me, uh, tidy up here.

629
00:45:51,243 --> 00:45:53,480
I'll probably take a shower. I'll be down soon.

630
00:45:53,515 --> 00:45:55,953
- Okay
- All right.

631
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:57,923
Oh, hey. You know when you were

632
00:45:57,957 --> 00:46:00,796
asking me about the sites I was looking at,

633
00:46:00,829 --> 00:46:03,167
whether I fantasize about being
the one inflicting the pain

634
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,304
or the one being tortured?

635
00:46:06,306 --> 00:46:07,442
It's the former.

636
00:46:09,212 --> 00:46:12,151
Okay, sweetheart.

637
00:46:12,185 --> 00:46:13,755
Thanks for telling us.

638
00:46:15,525 --> 00:46:17,796
Get you some breakfast.

639
00:46:25,612 --> 00:46:29,052
I really think we should
have a session about this.

640
00:46:29,085 --> 00:46:30,956
I got some time between 4:00 and 6:00.

641
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:32,258
There's another therapist here,

642
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:33,528
so I'm just fighting for office hours.

643
00:46:33,561 --> 00:46:35,064
I'm good, thanks.

644
00:46:35,097 --> 00:46:37,101
You just murdered four girls.

645
00:46:37,135 --> 00:46:39,372
We need to talk about your feelings about this.

646
00:46:39,406 --> 00:46:42,478
Why? I've never felt better in my life.
