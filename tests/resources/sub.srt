A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:00:29,685 --> 00:00:30,925
<i>Ship's log.</i>

3
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:33,205
<i>Ten days sailing.</i>

4
00:00:34,365 --> 00:00:37,405
<i>Ten days and three people</i>
<i>have already been murdered</i>

5
00:00:37,485 --> 00:00:39,085
<i>on this damned ship.</i>

6
00:00:41,165 --> 00:00:43,365
<i>All we can do is keep going.</i>

7
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:46,685
<i>But if I don't make it to land alive,</i>

8
00:00:47,765 --> 00:00:49,845
<i>I want to leave a record of what happened</i>

9
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:52,125
<i>so that the appropriate action</i>
<i>can be taken.</i>

10
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,965
<i>It all began on departure day.</i>

11
00:00:57,525 --> 00:01:01,725
<i>People boarded the ship believing</i>
<i>it'd be the best voyage of their lives.</i>

12
00:01:02,845 --> 00:01:04,485
<i>They were so wrong.</i>

13
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:05,725
BUENOS AIRES ROUTE

14
00:01:29,605 --> 00:01:31,645
- Are you nervous?
- A little.

15
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:33,205
And you?

16
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:35,325
A little as well.

17
00:01:36,085 --> 00:01:38,805
I guess that's what happens
with one-way trips.

18
00:01:39,765 --> 00:01:41,725
Look! There it is!

19
00:01:45,925 --> 00:01:46,965
Be careful!

20
00:01:53,925 --> 00:01:55,485
No, no. Don't move, please.

21
00:01:55,565 --> 00:01:56,845
- I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

22
00:01:57,605 --> 00:01:59,645
- Yes, I can manage on my own.
- Let me through.

23
00:02:03,605 --> 00:02:05,805
Please, help me. They're going to kill me.

24
00:02:05,885 --> 00:02:06,805
What?

25
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:09,205
If they find me, they're going to kill me.

26
00:02:10,765 --> 00:02:11,765
I'll get the police.

27
00:02:11,845 --> 00:02:15,045
No. Not the police! I just need
to get on board no matter what.

28
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,165
That's impossible.
Tickets sold out weeks ago.

29
00:02:17,245 --> 00:02:19,085
- Carol!
- Ladies, get in the car, please.

30
00:02:19,165 --> 00:02:21,805
- Who will defend women if we don't?
- Eva!

31
00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:24,565
There are guards everywhere.
We can't do it.

32
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,845
- Please, I'm begging you.
- Don't cry, please.

33
00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:30,165
He'll kill me.

34
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:32,725
There's a way we can help.

35
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:08,165
I don't understand you.

36
00:03:12,565 --> 00:03:15,965
- You're crazy. Crazy.
- Shut up, Francisca, please.

37
00:03:16,645 --> 00:03:18,845
She and her obsession with helping people!

38
00:03:18,925 --> 00:03:21,565
- Why did you let her do this?
- I didn't.

39
00:03:23,525 --> 00:03:27,285
Francisca is right, Eva. One of these days
you'll get us in serious trouble.

40
00:03:27,365 --> 00:03:30,045
That day is today.

41
00:03:36,605 --> 00:03:38,085
THE ALBATROSS

42
00:03:38,205 --> 00:03:40,285
Good morning. What is your destination?

43
00:03:42,405 --> 00:03:43,325
Rio de Janeiro.

44
00:03:44,805 --> 00:03:47,405
- Want to declare anything?
- Excuse me?

45
00:03:48,325 --> 00:03:49,165
Nothing.

46
00:03:52,085 --> 00:03:54,125
- Have a good trip.
- Thank you.

47
00:03:54,205 --> 00:03:55,165
Thanks a lot.

48
00:04:00,805 --> 00:04:01,925
Detective Varela.

49
00:04:03,645 --> 00:04:05,445
I'm in charge of security on board.

50
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,245
Why isn't this trunk in the hold
with the rest of the heavy baggage?

51
00:04:15,405 --> 00:04:18,645
I don't know if you're aware,
but a wedding will take place on the ship.

52
00:04:18,805 --> 00:04:20,965
Fernando Fábregas,
he owns the shipping company.

53
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:23,045
Yes.

54
00:04:24,725 --> 00:04:25,925
Of course I'm aware.

55
00:04:26,005 --> 00:04:27,605
My sister is his fiancée.

56
00:04:29,605 --> 00:04:30,805
My apologies, miss.

57
00:04:33,645 --> 00:04:36,565
- Congratulations on the wedding.
- Thanks a lot.

58
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:42,605
Have a safe journey.

59
00:04:42,805 --> 00:04:44,005
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

60
00:05:02,765 --> 00:05:06,445
If I may say so, miss, this is
the craziest thing you've ever done.

61
00:05:06,525 --> 00:05:08,165
I don't know how I'll do it.

62
00:05:16,845 --> 00:05:17,685
Brazil.

63
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:31,965
- Everything's going to be all right.
- Yeah.

64
00:05:40,245 --> 00:05:41,205
This is wonderful!

65
00:05:47,845 --> 00:05:49,365
Welcome aboard.

66
00:05:50,085 --> 00:05:52,285
Welcome aboard
the <i>Bárbara de Braganza,</i> ladies.

67
00:05:52,365 --> 00:05:53,325
It's our pleasure.

68
00:05:53,405 --> 00:05:56,645
- Have a safe journey.
- Would you like a glass of champagne?

69
00:05:59,605 --> 00:06:01,605
Yes, I need it.

70
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,525
My nieces!

71
00:06:03,605 --> 00:06:07,165
Uncle Pedro.
We're so glad you could make it.

72
00:06:07,245 --> 00:06:10,965
How could I miss one of my favorite
niece's wedding?

73
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:11,925
I have two favorites.

74
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:13,925
- How are you, uncle?
- And you?

75
00:06:14,285 --> 00:06:15,485
We're good.

76
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,765
We're still not used to being without him.

77
00:06:18,485 --> 00:06:21,885
I want raspberry cake, Francisca.

78
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,165
This trip must be a celebration

79
00:06:24,245 --> 00:06:25,805
to honor your father's memory.

80
00:06:26,005 --> 00:06:27,485
That's it, uncle.

81
00:06:27,565 --> 00:06:29,165
- We have to look ahead.
- Of course.

82
00:06:29,245 --> 00:06:30,525
It's what he would've wanted.

83
00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:33,565
- Do you already have your key?
- Yes. I'll go get settled.

84
00:06:33,645 --> 00:06:36,125
And we can meet later, if you agree,

85
00:06:36,205 --> 00:06:39,645
to see the ship set sail.

86
00:06:40,685 --> 00:06:42,645
Of course, uncle. We'll meet you there.

87
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:44,925
Go ahead then. Go ahead.

88
00:06:52,925 --> 00:06:55,165
- We'll end up getting arrested.
- What did I tell you?

89
00:06:55,245 --> 00:06:57,885
- You don't want to hear me.
- So why am I still hearing you?

90
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:00,965
Excuse me.

91
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,685
Do you know if Mr. Fábregas
can see us soon?

92
00:07:03,765 --> 00:07:06,845
Don't worry, Miss Villanueva.
I've sent word that you're here.

93
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:12,445
Eva.

94
00:07:13,285 --> 00:07:15,285
There's a man over there, staring at us.

95
00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:18,885
Here you go. Cabin 130.

96
00:07:18,965 --> 00:07:21,965
One of the best cabins on this ship.
The bell boy will help.

97
00:07:22,045 --> 00:07:24,405
Don't worry, Agustín. I'll see to it.

98
00:07:26,885 --> 00:07:30,005
Nicolás Vázquez,
First Officer of the <i>Bárbara de Braganza.</i>

99
00:07:30,765 --> 00:07:32,245
You're the Villanueva ladies.

100
00:07:33,965 --> 00:07:36,285
You're correct. My name is Carolina.

101
00:07:37,245 --> 00:07:39,245
- This is my sister Eva.
- Nice to meet you.

102
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,245
It's a pleasure to have you on board.

103
00:07:42,325 --> 00:07:44,325
- Excited about the voyage?
- We are.

104
00:07:44,405 --> 00:07:45,605
I haven't slept for days.

105
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,805
And I think I won't for even more days.
Let's go.

106
00:07:49,165 --> 00:07:52,205
Mr. Fernando asked me to personally
take care of your accommodation.

107
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,805
They just boarded the ship.

108
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:19,165
It's a miracle it can float.

109
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,125
God has little to do with it.

110
00:08:22,205 --> 00:08:25,725
It's a miracle of engineering.
342 yards in length.

111
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,285
Have you seen the Eiffel Tower?

112
00:08:29,405 --> 00:08:31,405
Well, picture it lying on the sea.

113
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,605
She has a maximum speed of 32 knots,

114
00:08:34,685 --> 00:08:36,325
thanks to the 200,000 horsepower

115
00:08:36,405 --> 00:08:38,645
provided by 
our four turboelectric turbines.

116
00:08:38,725 --> 00:08:41,245
- That's amazing.
- 1650 passengers.

117
00:08:42,205 --> 00:08:43,125
1651.

118
00:08:49,885 --> 00:08:52,485
The cabins in first class have hot water,
of course.

119
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:55,605
The linen and towels are Egyptian cotton.
The best in the world.

120
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:58,965
The cabin and bathroom
will be cleaned every morning.

121
00:08:59,045 --> 00:09:01,245
- And here...
- Officer! Excuse me.

122
00:09:02,205 --> 00:09:04,285
I have to use the restroom.

123
00:09:07,085 --> 00:09:09,325
Of course, go ahead.

124
00:09:09,845 --> 00:09:10,685
Excuse me.

125
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:14,725
- Make yourselves comfortable, and welcome.
- Thanks.

126
00:09:19,245 --> 00:09:20,605
Excuse me.

127
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,485
I just wanted to remind you the captain
offers a gala dinner at nine.

128
00:09:23,565 --> 00:09:24,765
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

129
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:30,245
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

130
00:09:31,165 --> 00:09:32,005
Are you okay?

131
00:09:32,565 --> 00:09:34,205
Yes. Yes.

132
00:09:37,245 --> 00:09:39,325
Thank you, thank you.

133
00:09:42,045 --> 00:09:43,605
I don't know how to thank you

134
00:09:44,365 --> 00:09:46,725
for what you've done for me.
You saved my life.

135
00:09:47,245 --> 00:09:48,805
You don't have to thank us.

136
00:09:49,565 --> 00:09:52,125
But my fiancé owns this ship.
I have to let him know you're here.

137
00:09:52,205 --> 00:09:53,205
No, no, no.

138
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:55,765
They'll make me get off the ship, miss.

139
00:09:56,245 --> 00:09:58,125
Please wait until the ship has set sail.

140
00:09:58,205 --> 00:10:01,325
I'm asking you, please,
don't let them take me back to port.

141
00:10:01,885 --> 00:10:04,405
The longer you wait to report this,
the worse it will get.

142
00:10:04,485 --> 00:10:06,325
- Francisca, please.
- Eva!

143
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:07,725
Francisca is right.

144
00:10:08,205 --> 00:10:09,605
At least, some common sense.

145
00:10:09,965 --> 00:10:11,685
I shouldn't have let you 
take her on board.

146
00:10:11,765 --> 00:10:13,885
You don't even want to know what happened?

147
00:10:17,565 --> 00:10:18,525
What's your name?

148
00:10:19,445 --> 00:10:21,205
My name is Luisa Castro Bermúdez.

149
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,525
Can you show us your papers?

150
00:10:25,885 --> 00:10:27,965
No, I haven't taken anything along, miss.

151
00:10:28,285 --> 00:10:32,765
- I ran off with nothing but these clothes.
- Don't worry. This isn't an interrogation.

152
00:10:32,845 --> 00:10:33,725
Yes, it is.

153
00:10:35,805 --> 00:10:36,805
Who are you running from?

154
00:10:40,645 --> 00:10:43,885
If you don't trust us,
we have no reason to trust you.

155
00:10:45,285 --> 00:10:46,965
I'm running away from my fiancé.

156
00:10:48,725 --> 00:10:51,085
They're forcing me to marry him,
but I don't love him.

157
00:10:51,165 --> 00:10:54,125
How come? This isn't the past century.
You can refuse.

158
00:10:54,205 --> 00:10:56,885
I have. That's why he wants to kill me.

159
00:10:56,965 --> 00:10:59,925
He told me that if I don't marry him,
I won't marry anyone.

160
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:01,725
I know that if he finds me,

161
00:11:02,405 --> 00:11:03,325
he'll kill me.

162
00:11:04,805 --> 00:11:06,405
Why don't you call the police?

163
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:08,525
He's a powerful man.

164
00:11:09,165 --> 00:11:12,285
I want... I want to go far away,
to live in peace.

165
00:11:14,085 --> 00:11:16,405
I'm begging you, please.
Don't say anything

166
00:11:16,805 --> 00:11:19,125
until we're on the high seas.
After that, I won't bother you.

167
00:11:19,605 --> 00:11:22,805
- Dad would help this girl. I'm sure of it.
- Don't do this, Eva.

168
00:11:23,285 --> 00:11:25,325
Don't bring up Dad to persuade me.

169
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,765
I'm sorry,
but things have to be done properly.

170
00:11:35,005 --> 00:11:36,325
Carol, please.

171
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:37,925
Don't tell Fernando.

172
00:11:48,765 --> 00:11:49,605
Yes, go ahead.

173
00:11:50,005 --> 00:11:50,885
Be right there.

174
00:11:51,485 --> 00:11:53,245
Yes. I'll be right there!

175
00:11:56,205 --> 00:11:57,165
Yes, thank you.

176
00:12:02,965 --> 00:12:03,965
You're here.

177
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:06,365
- Is this a bad time?
- No, not at all.

178
00:12:07,725 --> 00:12:09,085
I really wanted to see you.

179
00:12:11,525 --> 00:12:14,125
How are you? Do you like your cabin?
Come in, please.

180
00:12:14,205 --> 00:12:17,805
We just wanted to say hi.
We don't want to bother you.

181
00:12:18,365 --> 00:12:21,125
- I know you must be very busy.
- You never bother me.

182
00:12:23,485 --> 00:12:24,445
Is there a problem?

183
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:27,045
No.

184
00:12:27,925 --> 00:12:30,405
Are you nervous about the trip?
About the wedding?

185
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:32,605
No.

186
00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:36,445
- I wanted to tell you...
- Hello.

187
00:12:36,525 --> 00:12:39,565
<i>At midnight, on the upper deck.</i>

188
00:12:39,645 --> 00:12:42,925
<i>By the lifeboat number six.</i>

189
00:12:43,765 --> 00:12:45,205
<i>At midnight.</i>

190
00:12:49,485 --> 00:12:51,685
They've confirmed all guests are on board.

191
00:12:51,765 --> 00:12:53,485
They'll have everything they need.

192
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:56,405
These are their cabins.
In case you want to go say hello.

193
00:12:57,365 --> 00:12:58,205
Yes.

194
00:12:59,525 --> 00:13:01,845
We'll have time to be together at dinner.

195
00:13:02,725 --> 00:13:05,445
- Thanks for doing this.
- Anything for you, my love.

196
00:13:05,525 --> 00:13:07,205
What did you want to say?

197
00:13:08,725 --> 00:13:09,565
It's nothing.

198
00:13:10,445 --> 00:13:13,245
I'll go to the hold to make sure
everything's in order.

199
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:16,325
- Do you need anything?
- No, nothing. Everything's fine.

200
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:20,885
- Are you sure nothing's wrong?
- No, nothing's wrong. What could be wrong?

201
00:13:20,965 --> 00:13:22,045
Go, don't worry.

202
00:13:22,805 --> 00:13:23,685
See you later.

203
00:13:27,085 --> 00:13:29,565
- Thanks.
- I hope I won't regret this.

204
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:39,965
Well?

205
00:13:41,885 --> 00:13:45,005
We'll wait until we're on the high seas
to tell what happened.

206
00:13:45,085 --> 00:13:48,405
- This way, they won't send you back.
- Thank you, miss.

207
00:13:48,805 --> 00:13:52,045
You should thank my sister.
It's hard to oppose her.

208
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,205
Thank you. Really, you've saved my life.

209
00:13:58,445 --> 00:14:02,045
It's obvious this girl can't stay here
a minute longer.

210
00:14:03,645 --> 00:14:05,245
She'll come to our cabin.

211
00:14:05,325 --> 00:14:08,125
That way, you won't risk getting caught
with a stowaway.

212
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:10,045
Thank you, Francisca.

213
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,685
Wait.

214
00:14:20,365 --> 00:14:21,565
Take a copy of the key.

215
00:14:22,605 --> 00:14:24,885
You'll have to come here often
to bring stuff.

216
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:34,325
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Fernando.

217
00:14:34,405 --> 00:14:37,165
I've been informed you've stored
my fiancée's and her sister's boxes.

218
00:14:37,245 --> 00:14:38,085
Yes, sir.

219
00:14:46,925 --> 00:14:47,765
Here they are.

220
00:14:48,885 --> 00:14:50,325
Perfect, thank you.

221
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,365
Have someone take their trunks
to the cabins.

222
00:14:53,445 --> 00:14:54,405
Yes, sir.

223
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,085
Off to Brazil.

224
00:15:14,165 --> 00:15:15,165
Off to Brazil.

225
00:15:16,285 --> 00:15:17,805
- Captain.
- Captain.

226
00:15:21,525 --> 00:15:23,205
What does the weather report say?

227
00:15:24,285 --> 00:15:26,285
Clear skies for the first three days.

228
00:15:26,645 --> 00:15:29,245
With gusts of wind from the northeast.
Force four.

229
00:15:29,325 --> 00:15:31,165
Minimum temperature of 70 degrees...

230
00:15:34,045 --> 00:15:35,125
An albatross!

231
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:37,325
It's unusual to see them here.

232
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:39,685
It's a bad omen.

233
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:42,005
No superstitions on my ship.

234
00:15:42,085 --> 00:15:44,725
Have someone take it away
and fix that crack.

235
00:15:48,285 --> 00:15:49,805
We have to set sail.

236
00:15:49,885 --> 00:15:51,085
Yes, captain.

237
00:15:55,685 --> 00:15:58,245
- Are you all right, captain?
- Yes, yes. I'm fine.

238
00:16:12,085 --> 00:16:15,045
Now, now we are really leaving.

239
00:16:15,885 --> 00:16:18,005
I thought this moment would never come.

240
00:16:18,085 --> 00:16:21,165
It will be a great journey.
We must enjoy it.

241
00:16:22,285 --> 00:16:25,685
- I hope you're right, uncle.
- I am, my niece, I am.

242
00:16:26,365 --> 00:16:29,645
They say that after a storm comes a calm.

243
00:16:30,005 --> 00:16:32,285
Well, upon Francisca's cakes,

244
00:16:32,365 --> 00:16:35,805
I can assure you the storm's over.

245
00:16:48,885 --> 00:16:50,325
Who would've thought?

246
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,165
When I first met you, you were

247
00:16:53,725 --> 00:16:56,685
a ragged boy walking
around those shitty streets.

248
00:16:57,325 --> 00:16:58,445
Look at yourself know.

249
00:16:58,965 --> 00:17:02,005
This ragged boy cannot thank you enough,
captain.

250
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,485
Let's set sail.

251
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,085
Slow ahead!

252
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:18,125
Slow ahead!

253
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:59,685
<i>Tonight, no light will shed</i>

254
00:17:59,765 --> 00:18:03,165
<i>The lamp by the ocean</i>

255
00:18:03,525 --> 00:18:07,125
<i>Tonight, no light will shed</i>

256
00:18:07,205 --> 00:18:10,365
<i>'Cause it's out of gas</i>

257
00:18:11,085 --> 00:18:14,605
<i>'Cause it's out of gas</i>

258
00:18:14,685 --> 00:18:17,965
<i>'Cause it's out of gas</i>

259
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:21,325
<i>Tonight, no light will shed</i>

260
00:18:22,005 --> 00:18:25,005
<i>The lamp by the ocean</i>

261
00:18:25,085 --> 00:18:28,725
<i>They say you're leaving</i>
<i>To La Gomera</i>

262
00:18:28,805 --> 00:18:32,365
<i>They say you're leaving</i>
<i>But you won't take me with you</i>

263
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:36,005
<i>But you won't take me with you</i>
<i>But you won't take me with you</i>

264
00:18:36,085 --> 00:18:39,325
<i>They say you're leaving</i>
<i>To La Gomera</i>

265
00:18:39,805 --> 00:18:43,405
<i>They say you're leaving</i>
<i>To La Gomera</i>

266
00:18:43,485 --> 00:18:47,325
<i>They say you're leaving</i>
<i>But you won't take me with you</i>

267
00:18:47,525 --> 00:18:51,325
<i>Virgin of La Candelaria</i>

268
00:18:51,405 --> 00:18:53,645
<i>The prettiest of them all</i>

269
00:18:54,005 --> 00:18:57,325
<i>The prettiest of them all</i>

270
00:18:57,965 --> 00:19:01,125
<i>She lays her veil</i>

271
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:08,365
- We're off to a good start.
- Shut up, Verónica.

272
00:19:08,485 --> 00:19:11,645
No, mother. I won't shut up.
I've been biting my tongue for an hour.

273
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:16,485
If bringing this stowaway was
their idea, they should deal with her.

274
00:19:18,085 --> 00:19:21,005
I only see two beds.
Can you tell me where we'll sleep?

275
00:19:21,085 --> 00:19:23,925
That's easy. You and her sleep here,
I'll sleep there.

276
00:19:24,005 --> 00:19:26,885
I can sleep anywhere.
I don't want to cause any trouble.

277
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,445
A bit late for that, don't you think?

278
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:34,565
I understand, but you can't imagine
what it means to start from scratch.

279
00:19:34,645 --> 00:19:37,165
Yes, but not all of us will start
from scratch.

280
00:19:37,245 --> 00:19:38,965
Some of us will have the same life

281
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:41,645
here, in Brazil, and in China.
We'll be serving our masters.

282
00:19:42,285 --> 00:19:44,365
It's an honorable job as any other.

283
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,725
If you consider this to be honorable,
do it yourself.

284
00:19:46,805 --> 00:19:48,885
What have I told you? Mind your mouth.

285
00:19:49,325 --> 00:19:50,965
Help me unpack.

286
00:20:38,525 --> 00:20:39,405
Carolina!

287
00:20:39,845 --> 00:20:41,605
Natalia! You startled me!

288
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:44,165
How come you're not with my brother?

289
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:46,765
He's in the hold,
making sure the ship won't sink.

290
00:20:49,205 --> 00:20:53,365
Get used to it. Fernando's always
like this. Work comes first.

291
00:20:54,525 --> 00:20:58,005
You still have time to run away
and avoid the mistake of marrying him.

292
00:20:58,085 --> 00:20:59,725
I would never do that.

293
00:21:00,245 --> 00:21:02,525
If Fernando is busy, you should join us.

294
00:21:03,365 --> 00:21:05,925
We'll have a martini at the bar
before dinner.

295
00:21:08,805 --> 00:21:10,125
I appreciate it.

296
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:14,245
But I still have to get ready for dinner.

297
00:21:19,325 --> 00:21:20,365
As you wish.

298
00:21:21,325 --> 00:21:23,165
You know where to find us.

299
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:36,165
Can I take your picture?

300
00:21:36,245 --> 00:21:38,205
- A picture?
- Yes.

301
00:21:38,405 --> 00:21:40,765
- Here?
- That's perfect.

302
00:21:44,685 --> 00:21:46,525
Is there something wrong, Eva?

303
00:21:48,005 --> 00:21:49,685
I'm sorry for everything, uncle.

304
00:21:50,525 --> 00:21:55,125
Look, your sister can do
whatever she wants with her life.

305
00:21:55,285 --> 00:21:58,125
True, after your father passed away,
I would've liked

306
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:02,085
her to lead the company with me.

307
00:22:02,165 --> 00:22:03,525
You could've done it on your own.

308
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:07,925
It didn't make any sense,
without your father and sister.

309
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:10,045
I'm really glad I sold the company.

310
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:14,605
- And I understand your sister's decision.
- The truth is that I don't.

311
00:22:14,685 --> 00:22:19,045
You'll tell me the truth
when you fall in love.

312
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:22,445
If I ever do, I won't give up on myself.

313
00:22:22,525 --> 00:22:25,325
It's my turn to take your picture. Smile.

314
00:22:25,405 --> 00:22:28,365
Bigger smile. Smile, that's it. Smile!

315
00:22:28,685 --> 00:22:29,605
That's it.

316
00:22:30,045 --> 00:22:32,085
Your sister didn't give up on anything.

317
00:22:32,405 --> 00:22:34,205
She simply changed her business.

318
00:22:34,845 --> 00:22:36,445
It's not shoes,

319
00:22:36,525 --> 00:22:39,965
but evidently it's a good business.

320
00:22:42,285 --> 00:22:45,685
This may be the best for everyone.
Who knows?

321
00:22:47,205 --> 00:22:49,405
Carolina is a smart girl.

322
00:22:49,845 --> 00:22:51,885
She's not like you, but...

323
00:22:52,645 --> 00:22:54,125
Now I'll go get ready

324
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:55,925
for the captain's dinner.

325
00:22:58,005 --> 00:22:58,885
Go ahead.

326
00:23:09,365 --> 00:23:11,565
Dimas, please.
Can't you see a lady's coming?

327
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:13,005
I'm sorry.

328
00:23:14,965 --> 00:23:16,285
- Thanks.
- Excuse me.

329
00:23:16,765 --> 00:23:17,605
Do I know you?

330
00:23:18,925 --> 00:23:20,045
I honestly doubt it.

331
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,485
No, you're right. I would remember.

332
00:23:22,565 --> 00:23:26,045
I'm Sebastián de la Cuesta.
With whom do I have the honor of speaking?

333
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:29,965
- Verónica. Verónica de García.
- Verónica. Do you like your name?

334
00:23:30,045 --> 00:23:31,165
It's a beautiful name.

335
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:36,005
It means "victorious woman" in Greek.
Berenike. "Victorious woman."

336
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:37,445
Is that you?

337
00:23:38,805 --> 00:23:40,565
- I'm not...
- First time on a ship?

338
00:23:40,645 --> 00:23:41,685
Let's go up on deck.

339
00:23:42,245 --> 00:23:45,005
It's beautiful how the land
moves further ahead.

340
00:23:45,085 --> 00:23:47,325
It's a spectacle. You must see it.

341
00:23:47,405 --> 00:23:49,285
Actually, it's us that move.

342
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,125
Land doesn't go anywhere.

343
00:23:51,205 --> 00:23:53,325
Land goes wherever you want it to.

344
00:23:53,525 --> 00:23:57,125
You're right. This is what I get
for trying to impress a smart lady.

345
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:58,645
Have a good evening.

346
00:23:59,085 --> 00:24:00,205
I hope to see you again.

347
00:24:03,405 --> 00:24:06,565
I hate it when she goes,
but I love watching her leave.

348
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:21,085
I hope you won't start writing now.

349
00:24:21,605 --> 00:24:22,445
No.

350
00:24:24,725 --> 00:24:28,845
Don't overthink it. I'm sure you'll finish
your novel when we get to Rio.

351
00:24:29,165 --> 00:24:30,245
I hope so.

352
00:24:31,325 --> 00:24:34,205
I haven't been able to write a word
since Dad passed away.

353
00:24:36,205 --> 00:24:38,565
- Can you get the door, please?
- Yes.

354
00:24:46,525 --> 00:24:47,525
Good evening, Eva.

355
00:24:51,805 --> 00:24:53,805
I think you shouldn't come to dinner.

356
00:24:53,885 --> 00:24:56,605
- Why?
- The other ladies will envy you

357
00:24:56,685 --> 00:24:59,005
and they won't travel on my boats again.

358
00:24:59,085 --> 00:25:00,245
You're exaggerating.

359
00:25:01,845 --> 00:25:04,765
How are you, Verónica?
I thought your mother would be here.

360
00:25:05,885 --> 00:25:07,525
She had things to take care of.

361
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:09,805
All right.

362
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,125
You need one more thing.

363
00:25:22,165 --> 00:25:23,605
It's the engineer's badge.

364
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:26,965
It belonged to our father.

365
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:31,085
I know he would like you to have it.

366
00:25:31,565 --> 00:25:34,205
It would be an honor. Thank you both.

367
00:25:38,765 --> 00:25:39,605
Shall we?

368
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:41,485
Verónica.

369
00:25:42,365 --> 00:25:46,285
- I think your mother needs your help.
- Yes, I'll tidy this up and go to her.

370
00:25:53,965 --> 00:25:55,085
Mr. Zalacaín.

371
00:25:59,045 --> 00:26:04,005
Angels are falling from Heaven!
Are you sure this is my table, Alfonso?

372
00:26:04,445 --> 00:26:07,285
Don't be offended, ladies.
I just want to double-check my luck.

373
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:09,885
Whoever says the captain
has the best table is mistaken.

374
00:26:10,965 --> 00:26:12,845
I thought this day would never come.

375
00:26:13,085 --> 00:26:15,605
I'm happy to see you here,
after all we've been through.

376
00:26:15,685 --> 00:26:19,365
It's been a hard time, but people
are starting to live again after the war.

377
00:26:19,525 --> 00:26:23,325
This ship is proof of that.
You can't imagine the state it was in.

378
00:26:23,405 --> 00:26:25,165
- Pure scrap.
- Mr. Fábregas.

379
00:26:25,645 --> 00:26:26,565
It's a pleasure.

380
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:28,245
Please, excuse me.

381
00:26:32,805 --> 00:26:35,205
At midnight. Don't forget.

382
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,445
The pleasure is mine. Thank you.

383
00:26:52,525 --> 00:26:55,565
My dear nieces. Walk beside me.

384
00:26:56,045 --> 00:26:59,245
Come beside me
so you can show off your uncle.

385
00:27:03,445 --> 00:27:04,285
Doctor!

386
00:27:05,645 --> 00:27:08,405
- I'm glad to see you.
- I'm not sure your sister agrees.

387
00:27:08,805 --> 00:27:12,045
As long as you're not holding a needle,
I won't run away.

388
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:14,525
I still remember her under the bed,
crying.

389
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:17,285
I'm glad you agreed to come.

390
00:27:17,685 --> 00:27:21,525
I'm so relieved that you're taking care
of all the passengers.

391
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:23,165
I hope I won't be necessary.

392
00:27:23,245 --> 00:27:25,845
It would mean everyone's
in perfect health.

393
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:51,245
I'm sorry. I got the wrong cabin.

394
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:54,605
No wonder I couldn't open the door.

395
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:14,325
Verónica should be here already.
Where the hell is that girl?

396
00:28:33,525 --> 00:28:34,925
Before we eat,

397
00:28:35,765 --> 00:28:39,725
I'd like to make a toast to the man
that's been my greatest example for years.

398
00:28:41,045 --> 00:28:42,885
He would've been the best father-in-law,

399
00:28:42,965 --> 00:28:45,765
but his passing away a few months ago
took that from me.

400
00:28:46,285 --> 00:28:48,245
Carlos Villanueva, my fiancée's father.

401
00:28:49,325 --> 00:28:53,005
A man committed to preserving,
in such a hard time for our civilization,

402
00:28:53,085 --> 00:28:54,525
values such as loyalty,

403
00:28:55,365 --> 00:28:56,445
love of one's family,

404
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:58,925
honor, and freedom.

405
00:28:59,645 --> 00:29:02,365
And now that we're about to start
a new life in Brazil,

406
00:29:02,765 --> 00:29:04,565
his absence feels greater.

407
00:29:06,325 --> 00:29:07,365
Here's to you, Carlos.

408
00:29:08,085 --> 00:29:10,805
So that from wherever you are,
you may guide our steps

409
00:29:11,805 --> 00:29:15,085
and so we can live our lives
in justice and in peace.

410
00:29:15,805 --> 00:29:16,645
To Carlos!

411
00:29:16,725 --> 00:29:19,045
- To Carlos!
- To Carlos!

412
00:29:27,885 --> 00:29:32,005
<i>No one understands my suffering</i>

413
00:29:32,885 --> 00:29:37,005
<i>I sing, because I can't cry no more</i>

414
00:29:37,085 --> 00:29:37,965
Carolina.

415
00:29:39,725 --> 00:29:43,725
Getting married is a hasty decision.
I've prepared a boat, so we can run away.

416
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,925
I have some days to think about it
before we get to the equator.

417
00:29:47,005 --> 00:29:48,485
You still have some nights too.

418
00:29:48,725 --> 00:29:52,245
- You should use this trip to settle down.
- What do you think I'm doing?

419
00:29:52,325 --> 00:29:55,605
In fact, if you don't hurry up,
I might settle down before you do.

420
00:29:56,365 --> 00:29:59,645
I'm sorry, I was talking about Eva.
I imagine you're free tonight.

421
00:30:00,085 --> 00:30:03,325
If it wasn't for your reputation,
I would accept.

422
00:30:04,005 --> 00:30:06,525
- But I'm not that naive.
- It's a shame.

423
00:30:06,685 --> 00:30:10,965
If you come near her, I'll shove you
on that boat you have and send you adrift.

424
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:14,125
- Want to dance?
- Of course.

425
00:30:14,365 --> 00:30:17,645
<i>The times I've cried</i>

426
00:30:17,725 --> 00:30:23,125
<i>For losing your love</i>

427
00:30:24,685 --> 00:30:27,925
<i>I look for you everywhere I go</i>

428
00:30:28,485 --> 00:30:33,445
<i>But I can't find you</i>

429
00:30:34,085 --> 00:30:37,765
<i>Why would I want to kiss anyone else?</i>

430
00:30:37,845 --> 00:30:41,325
<i>If your lips won't kiss me anymore</i>

431
00:30:43,605 --> 00:30:47,205
<i>And you</i>

432
00:30:47,405 --> 00:30:51,085
<i>Who knows where you are?</i>

433
00:30:52,205 --> 00:30:55,765
<i>Who knows what adventures you'll have?</i>

434
00:30:55,845 --> 00:31:01,085
<i>You're so far away from me</i>

435
00:31:02,045 --> 00:31:07,005
<i>From me</i>

436
00:31:09,525 --> 00:31:11,605
We're the most boring people on this boat.

437
00:31:12,845 --> 00:31:14,645
You'd like to be down there, right?

438
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:16,565
I'd like to be with Clara.

439
00:31:17,685 --> 00:31:20,205
If you open the window,
you might hear her sing.

440
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:27,805
Listen, I shouldn't have mentioned
the bad omen.

441
00:31:28,165 --> 00:31:29,805
The captain didn't take it well.

442
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,125
He seemed concerned.

443
00:31:33,205 --> 00:31:35,965
Don't worry. He won't hold it against you.

444
00:31:38,005 --> 00:31:41,845
It's his first voyage after a long time.
It's normal that he's worried.

445
00:31:43,725 --> 00:31:44,885
He's just sad.

446
00:31:45,685 --> 00:31:46,885
He misses his wife.

447
00:31:50,645 --> 00:31:52,485
But we can't do anything about that.

448
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:55,565
I hope this voyage helps him
get over that.

449
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:16,205
How is your first night on board?

450
00:32:17,525 --> 00:32:18,365
It's good.

451
00:32:19,845 --> 00:32:23,365
May I ask you what you're doing here?
It's late and you're alone.

452
00:32:24,605 --> 00:32:27,725
- I was trying to find the North Star.
- You won't find it there.

453
00:32:28,325 --> 00:32:30,205
You have to look this way.

454
00:32:33,445 --> 00:32:34,325
Over there.

455
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,525
It's one of those.

456
00:32:41,205 --> 00:32:43,765
To be honest,
I've never seen so many stars.

457
00:32:43,845 --> 00:32:48,805
You haven't? I can assure you they'll be
there tomorrow, and the day after that.

458
00:32:49,445 --> 00:32:53,845
Why don't you go get a glass of champagne?
I'm sure that would be a first too.

459
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,365
- No.
- No?

460
00:32:55,685 --> 00:32:59,365
I mean, yes. It would be my first time.
But I'd rather stay.

461
00:33:00,005 --> 00:33:01,005
Of course, me too.

462
00:33:02,005 --> 00:33:05,805
Who would want to be down there
with all the boring and stiff people?

463
00:33:06,725 --> 00:33:08,525
- And you're not like that?
- No.

464
00:33:09,645 --> 00:33:10,685
I'm the exception.

465
00:33:11,965 --> 00:33:13,405
I'll show you, if you come.

466
00:33:14,405 --> 00:33:16,565
Watch out, don't burn your hand
on the pipe.

467
00:33:21,805 --> 00:33:26,485
I'd love to, but my mother's not
feeling good. She's in the cabin.

468
00:33:27,285 --> 00:33:29,605
Don't tell me you left your mother alone.

469
00:33:30,205 --> 00:33:31,605
Go, go.

470
00:33:33,165 --> 00:33:36,925
I won't take it as a no. We'll have
that glass of champagne some other time.

471
00:33:37,365 --> 00:33:38,205
Of course.

472
00:34:16,085 --> 00:34:17,085
Fernando.

473
00:34:18,285 --> 00:34:20,485
- I have to tell you something.
- My watch has stopped.

474
00:34:21,365 --> 00:34:23,165
- What?
- My watch. What time is it?

475
00:34:24,085 --> 00:34:25,125
I don't know.

476
00:34:25,725 --> 00:34:27,725
- I guess it's midnight. Why?
- No reason.

477
00:34:27,805 --> 00:34:30,245
I'm expecting a cable from Rio,
it's important.

478
00:34:30,325 --> 00:34:31,525
Can't it wait?

479
00:34:33,765 --> 00:34:34,925
It'll just be a minute.

480
00:34:35,605 --> 00:34:38,205
- I'll see you later, okay?
- Fine.

481
00:34:38,845 --> 00:34:41,045
I'll go up to my cabin to change my shoes.

482
00:34:41,685 --> 00:34:43,005
I'll wait for you there.

483
00:34:54,845 --> 00:34:58,645
Captain, we've just received
the latest weather report. No changes.

484
00:35:04,885 --> 00:35:06,165
I'll go up to the bridge.

485
00:35:06,765 --> 00:35:10,605
- Not necessary. I just wanted to tell you.
- It's an order. Take my place.

486
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:13,125
Have a drink, enjoy the party.

487
00:35:16,685 --> 00:35:18,685
Captain, are you all right?

488
00:35:19,685 --> 00:35:25,005
I am. It's just that since Carmen died,
I don't enjoy these things so much.

489
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:28,805
You can understand that
more than anyone else.

490
00:35:30,285 --> 00:35:31,205
Don't worry.

491
00:35:38,045 --> 00:35:41,605
<i>Siboney</i>

492
00:35:42,325 --> 00:35:44,805
<i>I love you</i>

493
00:35:44,885 --> 00:35:50,645
<i>I'm dying for your love</i>

494
00:35:51,165 --> 00:35:53,645
<i>Siboney</i>

495
00:35:53,725 --> 00:35:56,125
- Are you waiting for someone?
- Why do you ask?

496
00:35:56,805 --> 00:36:00,205
Because you're all alone, just watching.
Like you don't know anyone.

497
00:36:00,605 --> 00:36:02,765
Honestly, I can't handle these situations.

498
00:36:02,845 --> 00:36:06,325
- That's why I try not to get in the way.
- Then you shouldn't go dance.

499
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:08,605
If it's with you, I'll do it.

500
00:36:08,685 --> 00:36:11,325
<i>That I love you</i>

501
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:15,765
<i>And that you are</i>

502
00:36:15,845 --> 00:36:21,005
<i>A treasure for me</i>

503
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:25,725
<i>Siboney</i>

504
00:36:25,805 --> 00:36:30,445
<i>I think of you</i>
<i>To your hand's lullaby</i>

505
00:36:31,525 --> 00:36:33,605
Don't you think you've had enough?

506
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,725
Clearly I haven't. I can still hear you.

507
00:36:39,005 --> 00:36:42,365
Why don't you go to bed
before you embarrass yourself again?

508
00:36:42,445 --> 00:36:46,125
<i>Listen to my voice</i>

509
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:47,765
That's what you want, isn't it?

510
00:36:47,845 --> 00:36:51,445
<i>Siboney</i>

511
00:36:52,205 --> 00:36:55,805
<i>If you don't come</i>

512
00:36:55,885 --> 00:36:56,725
What?

513
00:36:58,405 --> 00:37:00,285
Think I don't see you looking at her?

514
00:37:01,045 --> 00:37:05,245
<i>Siboney</i>

515
00:37:05,325 --> 00:37:08,205
<i>You're in my dreams</i>

516
00:37:08,285 --> 00:37:12,965
<i>I long for you</i>
<i>I wait for you anxiously </i>

517
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:18,485
<i>Siboney</i>

518
00:37:18,565 --> 00:37:21,485
<i>If you don't come</i>

519
00:37:21,565 --> 00:37:24,725
<i>I'll die of love</i>

520
00:37:25,725 --> 00:37:26,765
Are you okay?

521
00:37:28,245 --> 00:37:30,325
- I feel a little sick.
- Really?

522
00:37:31,085 --> 00:37:31,925
How come?

523
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:35,845
Let's go outside to get some fresh air.

524
00:37:36,325 --> 00:37:38,805
The first two days are the worst.

525
00:37:39,325 --> 00:37:41,605
Until our bodies get used to the sway.

526
00:37:41,685 --> 00:37:46,365
<i>I curse</i>

527
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:54,765
You live and learn.

528
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:58,725
A year ago, if anyone had told us

529
00:37:59,205 --> 00:38:03,005
that we'd be here, so carefree,
on our way to Brazil...

530
00:38:03,325 --> 00:38:05,645
Carefree? I'm not carefree.

531
00:38:05,885 --> 00:38:07,285
Why don't you try?

532
00:38:07,605 --> 00:38:10,845
Just try. You'll feel better, you'll see.

533
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:13,765
The worst is over.

534
00:38:14,445 --> 00:38:18,725
- And time will take care of everything.
- It will take a lot of time.

535
00:38:19,165 --> 00:38:21,845
And I won't breathe easily
until we get to Brazil.

536
00:38:25,405 --> 00:38:26,565
I'm going to dance.

537
00:38:48,045 --> 00:38:49,285
What are you doing here?

538
00:38:50,285 --> 00:38:51,365
Feeling better, miss?

539
00:38:52,605 --> 00:38:55,685
We've already danced together,
you can stop calling me miss.

540
00:38:56,085 --> 00:38:57,485
Of course, as you wish.

541
00:39:03,605 --> 00:39:05,565
I'm taken aback by all this darkness.

542
00:39:06,285 --> 00:39:08,245
You'll end up falling in love with it.

543
00:39:10,605 --> 00:39:12,205
How long have you been sailing?

544
00:39:13,045 --> 00:39:15,805
Almost ten years.
Honestly, I didn't want to be a sailor.

545
00:39:16,405 --> 00:39:20,805
When I was 15, I stole watches
at the port. Watches or whatever I could.

546
00:39:20,965 --> 00:39:22,725
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

547
00:39:23,365 --> 00:39:26,005
I'm not proud of it,
but I'm not ashamed either.

548
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:28,445
We were six at home, and we had no money.

549
00:39:29,365 --> 00:39:31,765
- Once, I stole this from the captain.
- This ship's captain?

550
00:39:31,845 --> 00:39:33,885
Yes. And he let me choose.

551
00:39:34,365 --> 00:39:37,645
He'd either take me to the police station
or enroll me in the naval academy.

552
00:39:37,725 --> 00:39:39,645
So I saw the opportunity and took it.

553
00:39:41,605 --> 00:39:42,565
What about you?

554
00:39:43,525 --> 00:39:46,405
Your sister's getting married,
and she's moving to Brazil.

555
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:48,405
But what's there for you?

556
00:39:49,325 --> 00:39:50,285
A man.

557
00:39:51,365 --> 00:39:52,245
Wow.

558
00:39:53,685 --> 00:39:55,325
I knew you couldn't be single.

559
00:39:56,085 --> 00:39:57,605
It's not what you're thinking.

560
00:39:59,645 --> 00:40:02,005
The man I want to meet
is a book publisher.

561
00:40:02,245 --> 00:40:05,005
I'm a writer, and he's interested
in something I wrote.

562
00:40:05,085 --> 00:40:08,605
This conversation keeps getting
more interesting.

563
00:40:10,045 --> 00:40:11,325
What's your novel about?

564
00:40:12,245 --> 00:40:13,845
Second chances.

565
00:40:15,005 --> 00:40:18,125
You're in the right place.
Everyone here is trying to find one.

566
00:40:20,805 --> 00:40:22,405
Have you written anything else?

567
00:40:22,885 --> 00:40:24,485
Yes, well...

568
00:40:25,245 --> 00:40:28,445
It's a book of short stories.
I wrote it a long time ago,

569
00:40:28,645 --> 00:40:30,125
and I don't want to remember.

570
00:40:32,685 --> 00:40:34,245
A woman fell into the water!

571
00:40:41,525 --> 00:40:42,445
Command bridge.

572
00:40:43,365 --> 00:40:45,005
Man overboard. Port side.

573
00:40:47,565 --> 00:40:49,125
Man overboard. Port side, sir.

574
00:40:53,965 --> 00:40:55,885
See to the engines!

575
00:40:55,965 --> 00:40:59,005
Note down our position!
60 degrees to port!

576
00:40:59,085 --> 00:41:00,645
60 degrees to port, sir!

577
00:41:00,965 --> 00:41:03,805
Now turn completely to starboard
and go back to position.

578
00:41:05,365 --> 00:41:08,965
I want everyone at their stations,
even if you have to drag them out of bed.

579
00:41:09,045 --> 00:41:10,525
- Yes, sir.
- Stop all engines.

580
00:41:17,165 --> 00:41:19,285
Carefully! Slowly!

581
00:41:20,765 --> 00:41:22,205
Easy, easy.

582
00:41:23,725 --> 00:41:24,765
Who saw her falling?

583
00:41:25,285 --> 00:41:26,125
Come with me.

584
00:41:28,765 --> 00:41:31,565
- Are you absolutely sure of what you saw?
- Yes, I'm sure.

585
00:41:32,525 --> 00:41:35,485
- The lights cast a shadow at night.
- No, captain. I'm sure.

586
00:41:35,565 --> 00:41:38,365
It was a woman. I heard her scream
right before she fell.

587
00:41:38,445 --> 00:41:41,125
I also heard it, but I couldn't see
anything, I had my back turned.

588
00:41:41,205 --> 00:41:44,565
- I just heard. Do you know who it was?
- We don't know anything yet.

589
00:41:44,645 --> 00:41:48,445
- I'm at your disposition, if I can help.
- Get people back to the dining room.

590
00:41:48,525 --> 00:41:52,005
- The crew needs some peace to work.
- Of course.

591
00:41:52,525 --> 00:41:53,445
Listen, please!

592
00:41:53,525 --> 00:41:56,525
Let's head back to the dining room.
We need your cooperation.

593
00:41:56,605 --> 00:41:58,565
Let's proceed inside in an orderly way.

594
00:42:00,045 --> 00:42:00,965
Thank you.

595
00:42:04,485 --> 00:42:06,165
Make tea and coffee for everyone.

596
00:42:07,845 --> 00:42:09,085
Have you seen my sister?

597
00:42:09,565 --> 00:42:12,885
She said she'd go upstairs to change
her shoes. She's not back yet?

598
00:42:13,325 --> 00:42:15,165
No. I must find her.

599
00:42:21,565 --> 00:42:23,525
I'm looking for my sister.
She went to the cabin.

600
00:42:23,605 --> 00:42:26,965
- Have you seen her?
- She was headed to third class area.

601
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:30,125
- What's wrong?
- A woman fell into the water!

602
00:42:49,925 --> 00:42:51,565
Oh, my God! You're here!

603
00:42:52,605 --> 00:42:53,765
You're trembling!

604
00:42:54,485 --> 00:42:56,445
What's happening? The ship has stopped.

605
00:42:57,525 --> 00:42:59,845
A woman fell into the water,
and I thought it was you.

606
00:42:59,925 --> 00:43:02,525
I'm fine. But something happened.

607
00:43:06,045 --> 00:43:07,005
What is it?

608
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:13,165
Luisa hit me and went off. Be careful.

609
00:43:13,805 --> 00:43:16,125
She took your cabin's key, miss.

610
00:43:17,005 --> 00:43:19,325
The woman fell
from somewhere around our cabin.

611
00:43:20,045 --> 00:43:20,885
It can't be.

612
00:43:22,405 --> 00:43:24,965
Carol, we need to tell what happened.

613
00:43:28,525 --> 00:43:31,805
- Let me explain.
- No, Carolina. You acted recklessly.

614
00:43:48,485 --> 00:43:49,605
Come in.

615
00:43:53,085 --> 00:43:56,125
Everything is a mess.
What was she looking for?

616
00:43:56,205 --> 00:44:00,565
Make sure your valuables aren't missing.
All this is inconceivable.

617
00:44:00,645 --> 00:44:03,365
Her fiancé said he'll kill her
if she didn't agree to marry him.

618
00:44:03,765 --> 00:44:07,885
Kill her? I can't understand
why you didn't say anything.

619
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:11,885
If she was in danger, you should've told
someone, don't you think?

620
00:44:12,485 --> 00:44:15,445
We were waiting for the ship
to be further away from land.

621
00:44:15,525 --> 00:44:16,805
She came here to steal.

622
00:44:16,885 --> 00:44:20,045
Everything she said about that man
was a lie.

623
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:22,525
No, she wasn't lying. I'm sure.

624
00:44:22,605 --> 00:44:24,765
You don't know her at all.
How can you be so sure?

625
00:44:24,845 --> 00:44:27,805
There was a fight here.
She was with someone. Don't you see?

626
00:44:29,085 --> 00:44:31,125
Luisa didn't fall, someone pushed her.

627
00:44:31,205 --> 00:44:32,765
- Eva.
- Miss.

628
00:44:33,405 --> 00:44:37,005
With all due respect, we don't even know
who the woman is that fell.

629
00:44:37,085 --> 00:44:39,565
Varela is right.
We can't make up absurd theories.

630
00:44:39,645 --> 00:44:42,685
- Absurd?
- Yes, as absurd as helping a stowaway.

631
00:44:42,765 --> 00:44:45,765
Of course, that's all she is. A stowaway.

632
00:44:45,845 --> 00:44:47,845
Who cares what could've happened to her?

633
00:44:47,925 --> 00:44:50,125
She's no one, right?

634
00:44:51,325 --> 00:44:52,725
Tidy up this place.

635
00:44:53,005 --> 00:44:54,405
You've done enough for today.

636
00:45:13,205 --> 00:45:14,485
Any news, sir?

637
00:45:18,045 --> 00:45:19,005
Sir?

638
00:45:19,885 --> 00:45:20,965
Are you all right?

639
00:45:22,005 --> 00:45:23,365
It wasn't an accident.

640
00:45:24,645 --> 00:45:25,885
What do you mean, sir?

641
00:45:27,405 --> 00:45:29,765
That woman didn't fall into the sea.

642
00:45:31,485 --> 00:45:32,325
Sir.

643
00:45:36,445 --> 00:45:39,845
How many times do I have to ask you
to fix this damned glass?

644
00:45:53,365 --> 00:45:55,885
- I don't think anything's missing.
- Me neither.

645
00:45:55,965 --> 00:45:58,005
It means she didn't come here to steal.

646
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:02,565
It's obvious that everything she said
about her fiancé was a lie.

647
00:46:02,645 --> 00:46:04,405
I have no idea what she wanted.

648
00:46:04,725 --> 00:46:08,405
Well, there is something
I haven't told you.

649
00:46:09,805 --> 00:46:12,485
A man tried to come in
while you were at dinner.

650
00:46:12,885 --> 00:46:14,365
What? What did he look like?

651
00:46:14,445 --> 00:46:16,485
I don't know.
There wasn't enough time to look.

652
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,165
And that's normal too?

653
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:21,085
We'll just sit here
and pretend nothing happened?

654
00:46:21,725 --> 00:46:23,045
What do you want us to do?

655
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:25,965
I know Luisa fell into the water,
and someone pushed her.

656
00:46:26,405 --> 00:46:29,565
No one seems to care, but I do.
I'll find out what happened.

657
00:46:35,045 --> 00:46:36,805
She fell from this place.

658
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:47,005
I'm sorry.

659
00:46:48,405 --> 00:46:49,645
It's all my fault.

660
00:46:53,085 --> 00:46:55,125
You shouldn't have brought her on board.

661
00:46:55,805 --> 00:46:57,125
But you already know that.

662
00:47:05,805 --> 00:47:07,405
She was inside the trunk, right?

663
00:47:08,365 --> 00:47:09,245
That girl.

664
00:47:11,365 --> 00:47:13,725
Yes. How did you know?

665
00:47:14,885 --> 00:47:16,205
It's what I would've done.

666
00:47:19,285 --> 00:47:20,605
Try to get some sleep.
